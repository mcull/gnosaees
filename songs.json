Consider elements like individuals joyfully engaged in a slow-dance, a parked luxury car with the keys thrown carelessly, red-cup kisses, people taking refuge in a basement from a tornado, and a dive bar frequently visited. There's an underlying theme of Texas hold 'em but remember, 'this ain't Texas'', suggesting a defiance of norms and an undercurrent of rebellion. A Middle Eastern woman and a Caucasian man are seen pouring sugar and whiskey, interpreted from the lines 'pour some sugar on me, honey too' and 'come pour some liquor on me, honey too'.",

A man, a Middle-Eastern in his late forties with an expression full of desire and bewilderment, grasps towards her, visually displaying a sense of unfulfilled greed for her attention.

The image should incorporate symbols of fame, rebellion, and resilience. Depict a town bathed in a red hue representing the title of the song. Emphasize the strong, legendary figure symbolizing the artist - a confident individual who refuses to conform. The figure should radiate energy and power. Another key element to incorporate are footsteps; a subtle nod to the repeated phrase 'Walk on by'. Finally, the image should emphasize the emotion and intensity of the song, capturing its essential message.",

A woman, of South Asian descent, who is the protagonist, should be shown immersed in the dance, revealing her devilish charm and beauty.

Visualize a couple, a South Asian man and a Black woman, making a strong emotional connection amidst a storm. They are in a worn-out car parked in a semi-empty school lot, a poignant setting. Show the man gently holding the woman's hand, his grip slightly loose due to an old, unhealed injury. In the background, create a faint silhouette of a cityscape, symbolizing the Upper West Side they dream about. The imagery should evoke feelings of youth, nostalgia, struggle, and undying affection, reflecting the song's key message.",

She beams with joy, excitement, and passion as she paints on a large unbounded wall. The previously gray and drab wall is filled with vibrant colors, life and exuberance under her touch. The process of painting seems transformative, her hand restores the beauty in discarded and broken artifacts that are now part of the mural. The scenery shifts with every stroke, literally a sunset coming to life in the painting. Despite the dull, rainy day outside, the mural radiates light. Just beside her, there's an Asian man, watching her with a devoted and love-filled gaze. His life, once monochrome, is bursting with colors because of her. There's an air of reinvention, her reckless touch making him believe in new beginnings.",

      "rewrittenPrompt": "An image of a vivid summer sunset on a holy night, the scene unfolding on a desolate, lengthy back road. A troop of 16 carriages is visible on the horizon, gradually moving away, carrying with them the dreams and fears symbolized as ethereal entities. The scene evokes a sense of melancholy, a quiet struggle, and the thirst for aspiration, underlined by the softly cascading tears. The structures in the vicinity hint at a home left behind early in life, with signs of hard work and prayers. Starlight casts eerie shadows, hinting at unforgettable sacrifices made in the name of legacy.",

      "rewrittenPrompt": "Illustrate an image inspired by a song, with no specific reference to real-life musicians. The central theme is the hope for someone to be 'bright, big and strong'. This person is ambitious, unafraid to break the norms ('rip up the contract') to achieve great heights ('where the stars at'). Wealth is also a key element in the storyline, characterized by a 'drop-top Porsche' and 'a hundred racks in the morning'. Infuse the image with an urban, luxurious essence. Dominant objects could include symbolic stars, a fancy car and money. Maintain an overall night city scene, possibly alluding to the 'black out' mentioned. The mood should be empowering, triumphant yet defiant.",

The piece should express the tone and essential message without using any typographical elements. It's a song that rests at the top of a list that includes various emotional and thematic landscapes found in a series of country songs. The scene could include elements such as a lone individual under a moonlit sky, representing the solitary introspection often found in this genre. Also included should be a celestial object that gives the impression of hope in the distance. Implement soft colors to emulate the soothing yet melancholic tones of the song.",

Set in the early morning, a rugged Middle-Eastern man stirring from sleep in the bed of a worn-out truck parked out in a yard. He's bewildered, hair tousled, cradling an empty whiskey bottle. His boots are kicked off nearby and he uses a camouflage jacket as a makeshift blanket, an empty corn bag offers a scant comfort as a pillow. In the background, a small, locked home silently stands. A resounding sense of regret and heartache is palpable in the air around him.",

JERSEY CITY PIER - DAY\nA live news update.  Network correspondent CINDY CHAN stands at the\nedge of the  dock, the statue plainly visible in the distance behind\nher.\n\nCINDY\n-- insist that the situation is under control.  Authorities have just\nagreed to the release of nine Radical Front prisoners in hopes of\nfreeing the hostages.\n(adjusting her hair)\nWe repeat: terrorists have taken Liberty Island, and are holding some\nforty hostages -- including tourists and maintenance workers --\ncaptive in the Statue of Liberty itself.\n\n3. FERRYBOAT - DAY\nThe ferry -- one of six anchored a half-mile off Liberty Island --\nhas been commandeered by a fully-armed SWAT TEAM.  The SWAT CAPTAIN,\nwho's in charge of negotiations, speaks to the terrorists via\nwalkie-talkie.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nYour demands have been met.  The prisoners and the money are on their\nway.  If you tune your TV to Channel 4 you'll see the copters\npreparing for takeoff.\n\n4. INT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT\nThe screen of a portable TV shows THREE HELICOPTERS lifting off from\nLaguardia.  We're in the OBSERVATION ROOM inside the statue's head.\nA TERRORIST holds a crowd of SQUEALING TOURISTS -- men, women,\nschoolchildren -- at bay with an automatic rifle.  Two others stand\nby the windows, scanning the harbor for signs of a double-cross; and\na fourth, the RINGLEADER, speaks into a walkie-talkie.\n\nRINGLEADER\nGood.  We got forty innocent people here.  One false move . . . and\nwe blow her brains out.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)\n(filter; from walkie-talkie)\nBlow whose brains out?\n\n5. EXT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT\nTIGHT on the ring of OBSERVATION WINDOWS situated just below the\njutting spikes of the CROWN.  CAMERA PULLS BACK rapidly to take in\nthe whole of the statue's head.\n\nRINGLEADER (O.S.)\n(a nasty laugh)\nLady Liberty, my friend.  Lady Liberty's brains!\n\n6. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nMOUNTING TENSION among the SWAT TEAM on deck.\n\nSWAT COP\nSons of bitches.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nRelax.  We'll nail 'em on the transfer.  Let's get those hostages out\nfirst.\n\nSWAT COP II\nCaptain . . . what the hell is that?\n\nAll eyes turn upward.  In the distance, a TINY SPECK descends from\nthe clouds and drops, in a perfectly vertical line, toward the head\nof the statue.  The SWAT CAPTAIN hoists a pair of binoculars:\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nShit.  Shit fire!!\n\nSWAT COP\nSir!  What is it?\n\n7. POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS\nA magnified view of the SPECK, which turns out to be a futuristic,\nblimplike HOVERCRAFT -- the OWLSHIP.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)\nChrist almighty, it's the goddamned Watchmen!\n\n8. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nIn the cabin we find THREE COSTUMED SUPERHEROES: the red-and-gold\nsuited CAPTAIN METROPOLIS; RORSCHACH, whose face is a shifting\ninkblot mask; and NIGHT OWL, who's manning the instrument panel.\n\nNIGHT OWL\nOkay, Adrian, we're in position.  What now?\n\nHe looks up at a monitor mounted over the controls.  ADRIAN VEIDT,\nblond scientific wizard, answers pensively from Watchmen HQ:\n\nVEIDT\n(on monitor)\nLet's take out their communications.  Drop the scrambler.\n\n9. EXT. HEAD OF STATUE - DAY\nA line drops from the OWLSHIP, and an ELECTRONIC DEVICE lands with a\nthud on the dome of Lady Liberty's crown.\n\n10. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nTERRORISTS staring at the portable TV screen; suddenly, it shows\nnothing but snow.  The RINGLEADER, suspicious, lifts his\nwalkie-talkie:\n\nRINGLEADER\nHey.  We got a problem here --\n\nHe releases the button.  No reply -- only loud, hissing STATIC.\n\nRINGLEADER\nCome in.  Do you read me?  Don't play around with us,\nGoddammit !\n\n11. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT\nThe SWAT CAPTAIN curses at his useless walkie-talkie.  Teeth bared,\nhe glowers up at the OWLSHIP and paces the deck in a psychotic\nfrenzy.\n\nSWAT COP\nIgnorant bastards!  They've jammed us!\n\nSWAT COP II\nWhat do we do now?\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nWe sit here with our thumbs up our butts.  As usual.\n\n12. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nA HULKING FIGURE, outfitted in SCUBA GEAR, emerges from the water.\nThere's an evil-looking RIFLE slung over his shoulder.  As he\nswaggers toward the base of the statue, he peels off his wetsuit to\nreveal yet another gaudy COSTUME underneath.\n\nSuperhero #4: THE COMEDIAN.  He pins a BADGE to his leather\nbreastplate; incongruously, it's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON -- and it\nmatches his own nasty SMILE as he marches forward into battle.\n\n13. INT. BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nA TRIO OF TERRORISTS standing guard near the entrance in the base of\nthe statue.  They're holding a JANITOR at gunpoint.  One of them is\nfumbling with his walkie-talkie, which has inexplicably gone\nhaywire.\n\nTERRORIST I\nBase to head.  Base to head.  Come in!\n(flustered)\nI can't get shit!\n\nTERRORIST II\nWhat the hell is going on??\n\nThere's a sudden metallic CLANG behind them.  They turn in unison --\njust as the COMEDIAN struts into frame, assault rifle in hand.\n\nPanic.  The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of\na long metal stairway.  One of them grabs the JANITOR, holds a gun to\nhis head.\n\nTERRORIST I\nI'M NOT JOKING!!\n\nThe COMEDIAN shrugs: okay.  He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED\nSHOTS directly into the JANITOR's gut.  The old man's body jerks twice\nand he slumps to the floor, stone dead.\n\nThe TERRORISTS stand there aghast.  For an instant they're too\nstunned to shoot.  The COMEDIAN breaks into a dopey grin --\n\nCOMEDIAN\nThe joke's on you.\n\n-- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As\nthe saying goes . . . it's nice to see a man who enjoys his work.\n\n14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nRORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor\nof the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --\n\n15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nA sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to\nthe nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL\nFIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.\n\nWhile the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point\nbehind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS\nand RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the\nstatue's upraised TORCH.\n\nThe TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the\nfar side of the torch.\n\nRINGLEADER\nI don't like this.  Go downstairs and see what's up.\n\n16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nRORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.\n\nRORSCHACH\nGot your flashgun?\n\nCAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and\ngoes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits\nbehind.\n\n17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nThe COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue's layout.\nHe spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor,\nthen strolls over and jimmies it open.\n\nANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one's different.\nThis one's a WOMAN.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nAbout time.  It stinks down there.\n\nCOMEDIAN\nB-team's upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.\n\nAs the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched\nwetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME\nunderneath.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nWhy do I get all the glamour jobs?\n\nCOMEDIAN\nA woman's work is never done.\n\n18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nThe TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later,\nCAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their\nguns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a\nTEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.\n\nRINGLEADER\nI don't know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.\n\nCAPT. METROPOLIS\nPlease.  There's something I'd like you to see first.\n\nHe holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer's flash.\nAll at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding\nlight has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the\nfloor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.\n\nAll except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who's wearing his special sunglasses.\nHe pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.\n\n19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER\nAn edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he's grabbed\nfrom behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at\nhis throat.\n\nCOMEDIAN\nOkay, Abdul.  Where's the bomb?\n\n20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nEveryone's slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the\nTERRORISTS tied up; he's consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.\n\nCAPT. METROPOLIS\nDon't cry, little one.  You're in good hands.\n(standing; to the crowd)\nNow everyone.  Listen carefully.  We're going out through the torch.\n\nHe goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the\ntorch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.\n\n21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER\nA METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH\nsecures it to the tip of the torch.\n\n22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT\nSILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nShould be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .\n\nCOMEDIAN\nJust barge in.  While they're staring at your tits we'll blow their\nballs off.\n\nThey look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead\nlanding.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist\nhits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the\nlanding.\n\n23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER\nGas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS' BOMB, and it's a big fat one, sits\nin a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with\nUNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the\nCOMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:\n\nCOMEDIAN\nWell.  They look distracted.\n(turning to face her)\nDon't suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nEddie -- !\n\nSuddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He\nturns.\n\nOne of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself\nover to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A\nSWITCH on the housing.\n\nA TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.\n\nCOMEDIAN\nSHIT!\n\nHe hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to\nblink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An\nempty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nWhat about the --\n\nCOMEDIAN\nFUCK 'EM!\n\nThere's a mountain-climber's CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it\naround the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only\na second before following suit.\n\n24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nCAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once,\nhe FREEZES.  There's a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as\nwell.\n\n25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nYET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL's instrument panel.\nHe looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.\n\nNIGHT OWL\nAdrian!\n\nVEIDT\nYeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.\n\nNIGHT OWL\nWell, good God, we can't just --\n\nVEIDT\nMission aborted, Daniel!\n\nNIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.\n\n26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT\nOn the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.\n\n27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER\nThe COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS\nthrowing off sparks against the cable.\n\n28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nCAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands\npressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and\nRORSCHACH, who's hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off\nthe torch.\n\n29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT\nTHE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE\ntouches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator\ndoors open, and the two of them dive through.\n\n30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER\nRORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP\nstreaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure\nof Lady Liberty.\n\nThree beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.\n\n31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nA heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an\noverhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.\n\n32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER\nSmoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat\nagainst a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling\nDEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.\n\n33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER\nThe furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of\nthe statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He\nturns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nThat's it.  I quit.\n\nThe water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --\n\n34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY\n-- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through\nthe harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the\ndemolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes\nwondering what the hell happened to his date.\n\nMeet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR.\nMANHATTAN.\n\nDown below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact --\nare crawling out of the wreckage.  The COMEDIAN looks up at the huge\nblue figure looming over them, and shakes a gnat-sized fist:\n\nCOMEDIAN\nASSHOLE!  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!?\n\nCUT TO:\n\n35. INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT\nThe Channel 4 Newsroom, with anchors SHEILA SHEA and JIM BRADLEY.\n\nSHEILA\nIn the face of mounting public pressure, the city of New York has\nrevoked its contract with Adrian Veidt's super-team.  Local police\nhave threatened a city-wide walkout if criminal charges against the\nWatchmen are dropped.\n\nOn the bluescreen behind them, red circles with diagonal crossbars\nsurround SIX HEAD SHOTS of the individual WATCHMEN.\n\nJIM\nAnd in Washington today, the Senate introduced legislation which\nwould ban all costumed adventurers nationwide.  Easy passage\nis expected.\n(shuffling his papers)\nWell, Sheila, it looks like the age of the superhero is officially\nhistory.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n36.  CREDITS SEQUENCE\nTIMEPIECES of every description -- pocket watches, grandfather\nclocks, travel alarms, all perfectly synchronized -- DRIFT UPWARD\nthrough a vast black void, ticking off the seconds.  At the stroke of\nmidnight, GONGS sound, BUZZERS buzz, BELLS tinkle -- and without\nwarning the clocks EXPLODE.  As gears and coils and crystals cascade\ndownward through the void, we SUPER TITLE:\n\nWATCHMEN\n\nFADE THROUGH TO:\n\n37. EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT\nDarkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we TILT\nUP the towering facade of a forty-story apartment building.  A BLIMP\ndrifts lazily through distant clouds; the sounds of traffic echo\nfaint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse -- where\nheavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a SHATTERED\nPLATE-GLASS WINDOW.  SUPER TITLE:\n\nNEW YORK CITY - TEN YEARS LATER\n\n38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nA ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by\nthe garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the\nhigh-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated\nbubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on\ntheir roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.\n\nA CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: \"NEW SKIRMISH ON\nAFGHAN BORDER.  RUSSKIES WALK OUT ON PEACE POWWOW.\"\n\nCUSTOMER\nCrazy reds don't know who they're messing with.\n(indicating the cop cars)\nWhat happened over there?\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nSome guy went sidewalk divin'  Twenny-five cents.\n\n39. EXT. HIGH-RISE - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT\nA riot of noise and color.  A plainclothes COP takes a statement from\nthe DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare\nwith sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.\n\nPATROLMAN\nSTAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!\n\nWe are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of\nreality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the\ncity -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance:\nhis standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his\nplastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears\na path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the\nback of a waiting ambulance.\n\nDET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and\nbuttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the\ninvestigation.\n\nBURNS\nHad a lot of blood in him.\n\nHYDE\nYou oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.\n\nBURNS\nNo idea who's behind this?\n\nHYDE\nSmall army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.\n\nBURNS nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window.\n\nBURNS\nHe would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a\ncall from Washington.\n\nHYDE\nWashington?\n\nBURNS\nThey want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.\n\nHYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after\nthe ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.\n\n40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nTIGHT ON a large placard: \"THE END IS NIGH.\"  The bearer of the sign,\na hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk\nspreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make\nout an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.\n\nThe NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his\ncollar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against\nthe kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick,\ncross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in\nresponse and plugs on.\n\nAt the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the\nsidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET\nCRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain\ngrate.\n\nIt's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its\nsurface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to\nmidnight.\n\nThe STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.  He stares off at the\nshattered window some forty stories above.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n41. INT. HIGH-RISE - HALLWAY - NIGHT\nCAMERA DRIFTS from the penthouse elevator down a long, plush-carpeted\ncorridor.  The hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading\n\"POLICE LINE -- DO NOT CROSS.\"  At the far end is a single door,\nSEALED OFF.\n\n42. INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT\nMOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and\noverturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture\nwindow.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are\nflapping wildly.\n\nA ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.\n\nSHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps\ninside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is\ninvisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the\nroom.\n\nThe apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints,\ngaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The\nflashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS\nand an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.\n\nThe INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains\nof a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky\nglass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for\nhis face.\n\nHe has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and\never-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should\nbe. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.\n\nWe've met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.\n\n43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk\ndainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood.\nOffhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL.\nHe tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his\ntrenchcoat pocket.\n\n44. INT. PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nThe beam shines across rumpled bedclothes, searches around the walls,\nand settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in closet.\nRORSCHACH steps inside, examines rack upon rack of expensive\nsuits.\n\nHe shoves the suits aside.  Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on\nthe wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP.\nTHUMP.\n\nHe pauses.  He's found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully\nalong the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a\nCONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing\na SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.\n\nHe reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a\nbizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit,\nrows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed\nPHOTOGRAPH.\n\nRORSCHACH examines the photo.  It's a group shot, six men, one woman,\nall dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is\nwearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN's\ncostume.\n\nThey're all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT.\nMETROPOLIS.  DR. MANHATTAN.  ADRIAN VEIDT.  And of course, RORSCHACH\nhimself.  As he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by, we\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n45. EXT. STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT\nA LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner\nstore.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with\nthe heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated\n-- old before his time.\n\nHe holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough\nto open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.\n\n46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT\nIn an alleyway just off the access street, there's a MUGGING in\nprogress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in\nknot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG\nsees what's happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious\ndecision to move on.  Then --\n\nVOICE\nHold up, papa-san!\n\nThe KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and\nspotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they\nmarch toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them,\nalmost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we\n\nCUT TO:\n\n47. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE\nSlow-mo, double-frame, or sepia-tone; you call it.  But whatever the\ngimmick, it should suggest that the events we're watching take place\nin a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.\n\nIt's out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in\nan alleyway not unlike the one we've just left.  There's a flurry of\nfists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--\n\n-- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME,\ntransporting us back to:\n\n48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT\nReal-time again.  Our reverie's been interrupted by a SHAFT OF\nWHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the\nalley.\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nHALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --\n\nThe KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the\nLIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair\nsome forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of\nthe kids.\n\nDREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the\nalleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past\nhelp.\n\n49. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nTHREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The\nsecurity system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN's\napartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.\n\nDREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs\nit carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for\nthe kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most\npeculiar sight:\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . Rorschach.\n\n50. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\nLeaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is\nthe aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up,\nexposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he's calmly eating a plate of\nbaked beans.\n\nDREIBERG\nHow did you get in here?\n\nIgnoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping,\nutterly emotionless whisper:\n\nRORSCHACH\nHiya, pardner.  Long time no see.\n\nDREIBERG\nDid anybody follow you?  See you come here?\n\nDREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn't care less --\nemits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can\nonto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup\nfrom a squeeze bottle.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nI can't believe you're back on the streets.  Good God, man, you're\nwanted on fourteen counts of murder.\n\nRORSCHACH\nAt least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.\n\nHe reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it\nto DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his\nfingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nLook familiar?\n\nDREIBERG\nSure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHuman bean juice.\n(beat)\nThe Comedian is dead.\n\nDREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture.\nHis jaw goes slack.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nHad a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up --\nbeautiful view.\nHope he enjoyed it on the way down.\n\nDREIBERG\nJesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?\n\nRORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nWell, God, he'd been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he\nmust've had enemies.\n\nRORSCHACH\nSo do I.  So do you.\n\nDREIBERG\nRorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just\nparanoia.\n\nRORSCHACH's head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG\nblinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But\nRORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the\nfront door.\n\nRORSCHACH\nMaybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with\na grudge.\n(pause)\nThought you might want to spread the word.\n\nDREIBERG\nHey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?\n\nRORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He\nopens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.\n\nRORSCHACH\nYou the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.\n\nHe reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo\nfrom the COMEDIAN's wall.  A moment later, he's gone.\n\nDREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone,\nCAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple\ntunic and mask . . .\n\n51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT\nA GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is\nfar from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome\ndesk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is\nADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he's\nDREIBERG's age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and\npale, he looks thirty.  When he's sixty he'll look forty.\n\nVEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic\npatents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his\noffice reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the\nlike.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE\nRINGS.\n\nVEIDT\nVeidt here.\n\n52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT\nDREIBERG\nAdrian?  Listen, it's Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach.\nI had to call you before he --\n\nVEIDT\nDaniel, slow down.  What's this about Rorschach?\n\nDREIBERG\nThe Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.\n\nVEIDT\nMy God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?\n\nDREIBERG\nIt's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's\n. . . I don't know, stalking us.\n\nVEIDT\nUs.  You mean the Watchmen.\n\nThe big CAT purrs; it's a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red\nfur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a\nchunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders\nDREIBERG's words.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nDaniel, Rorschach is insane.\n\nDREIBERG\nI know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells\nblood.\n\nVEIDT\nYou know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs\n-- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.\n\nDREIBERG\nHe's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at\nthis late date.\n\nVEIDT\nIf he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected\nyou.  Haven't I?\n(slight pause)\nDo you need money?\n\nDREIBERG\nNo.  I just wanted you to --\n\nVEIDT\nYou did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good\nnight.\n\nDREIBERG\nGood night.\n\nVEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a\ncigarette.  It's \"matchless\"; you ignite it guy striking the tip of\nthe cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a\nlong, slow drag.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\nBarbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the\ncheckpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE\nrolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign\nwhich reads \"ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER.\"\n\n54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\nADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED\nESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door\nwith a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a\nsix-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .\n\n. . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple\ndoorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and\nwait -- to VEIDT's great amusement.\n\nThe inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned\nwoman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK\nSPECTRE.\n\nLAURIE\nAdrian.\n\nVEIDT\nLaurie!  Good to see you.\n\nShe gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall\nin perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.\n\nLAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized\nmachines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific\nparaphernalia of every description.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nNice.  Who's your decorator -- Edward Teller?\n\nLAURIE\nDon't rub it in.  I live here.\n\nVEIDT\nAnd how's life with the walking H-bomb?\n\nLAURIE\nHe's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.\n\nShe takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT\nwanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A\nSMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:\n\nVEIDT\nHi, Jon.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)\n(a deep, booming voice)\nHello, Adrian.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under\nany circumstances, but at the moment he's downright gargantuan.\nForty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he's calmly adjusting a\ncalibration atop his particle accelerator.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\nI think I'm about to detect a gluino.\n\nIn case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just\nabout anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the\nphysical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of\ntime and space, DR. MANHATTAN is a chronic offender.\n\nAny government would be glad to have him.\n\nVEIDT\nSupersymmetrical theory, hmm?  Say, I understand old Schwartzmann\ncaught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .\n\nLAURIE, who's just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.\n\nLAURIE\nPlease, you guys, no shop talk.\n(to DR. MANHATTAN)\nJon, you're being rude.  Why don't you shrivel on down and join us?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable\nsix-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist\n-- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nGood to see you, Adrian.  What's the occasion?\n\nHe tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO\nSURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.\n\nVEIDT\n. . . Are we being monitored?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the\nlittle red \"ON\" lights wink out.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThe bearer of bad news.\n\nVEIDT\nWe've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.\n\nLAURIE\nBlake?  Dead?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the\nfuneral as a matter of protocol.\n\nLAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first\nshe's heard about it.\n\nVEIDT\nRorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to\nthink that someone is \"stalking\" the Watchmen.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nOh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.\n\nVEIDT\nWhat's your theory?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nLife and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern\nme.\n\nVEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is\nconsiderably less amused.\n\nLAURIE\nI could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?\n\nVEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another\npart of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as\nwe watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and\nfloats off to one side.\n\nA module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of\nthe hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in\nmidair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn't lifted a finger; he's dismantling and\nreassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.\n\nVEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes\nthe conversation without missing a beat:\n\nVEIDT\nI guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYou mean Afghanistan?\n(beat)\nIt won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more\ninteresting.\n\nThe module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The\ncover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws\nitself shut.\n\nVEIDT\nWell . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as\nusual -- I can't tell you anything you don't already know.  Goodbye,\nJon.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds\nhis coat where LAURIE put it.  He's just about to leave when she\narrives with two stiff drinks in hand.\n\nLAURIE\nAdrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --\n\nVEIDT\nI'll take a raincheck, Laurie.\n\nLAURIE\nPlease.\n\nThere's a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his\nshoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who's forty feet tall again, playing\nwith his superaccelerator.\n\nVEIDT\nHe's a little farther gone every time.\n\nLAURIE\nStay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to\nsomeone human.\n(beat)\nHe doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I\nmean -- he even scares the research teams.\n\nVEIDT\nLaurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed\nthe world.\n\nLAURIE\n(embarrassed)\nI know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's\ndoing his work --\n\nVEIDT\nWhat about you?\n\nLAURIE\nI suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.\n(pause)\nI'll ring for the guards.\n\nShe goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her,\nconcerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest\npocket for a cigarette case:\n\nVEIDT\nNasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.\n(handing her a cigarette)\nDarling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give\nDaniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.\n\nLAURIE\nMaybe I'll do that.\n\nVEIDT\nI'm sorry about Blake.\n\nHe pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS\nappear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.\n\nLAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman\nlover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and\nWALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren't there.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT\nA decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood,\npopular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow\nstairway which dips well below street level.\n\n56. INT. HAPPY HARRY'S - NIGHT\nThe usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS\nhover at the entrance to the men's room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS\nstand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and\ngrind.  Suddenly there's a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.\n\nOver by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE\noff the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of\nvicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the\nbar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing\nglasses.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHarry.\n\nHARRY\n(petrified)\nR-Rorschach.\n\nRORSCHACH\nPhone's out of order.  Mind if I use yours?\n\nHe reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH\npicks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS\nand yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.\n\nHe turns and faces the assembled multitudes:\n\nRORSCHACH\nEdward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might've had\nhelp.\n(wandering through the room)\nThought maybe you could fill me in.\n\nENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as\nRORSCHACH strolls past.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nYou.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing?\n(moving on)\nJohnny Gobs.  What's new at the schoolyard?\n\nBehind RORSCHACH's back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively\ntoward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar,\nyanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nNicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?\n\nNICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH\nextends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --\n\n-- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He\ncloses a gloved fist around NICKY's pinky finger, twists it back and\nSNAPS IT.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nEdward Blake.  Who killed him?\n\nNo answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH\ngrabs his index finger and repeats the process.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nWho killed Edward Blake?\n\nNICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to\nthe floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He's standing poised to let\nfly at NICKY's ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.\n\nVOICE\nJESUS!  HE'S IN SHOCK!!\n\nRORSCHACH\nTHE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?\n\nBy now HARRY's pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar.\nWithout looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It\ncatches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of\nglassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the\nceiling.\n\nSILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH's next move.  He\nlooks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nSo many vermin . . . so little time.\n\nHe bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY's quivering frame, and tosses it\ncontemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long\nenough to HISS at the crowd:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nGo back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I'll be\naround.\n\n\nCUT TO:\n\n57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN\nThe bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller\nresearch complex.  It's not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and\nLAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over\nto where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is\nempty.\n\nLAURIE\n(muttering; groggy)\nJon . . . ?\n\nA LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE\ncloses her eyes and sighs.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm here, Laurie.\n\nLAURIE\nIs it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nNot yet, there's plenty of time.\n\nA SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly.\nDR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.\n\nLAURIE\nMmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?\n\nThe BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE's shoulder and arm,\ntoward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWould you like me to stay?\n\nLAURIE\nMm hmm.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI could stay and go.\n\nLAURIE\n. . . And just how would you manage that?\n\nShe leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its\ndownward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is\nmassaging LAURIE's thigh.\n\nThird blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE's eyes go suddenly\nwide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the\nfoot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.\n\nLAURIE\nAAAAAAAAAA!!\n\nDR. MANHATTAN I\nLaurie?  Are you --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN II\nDon't be upset.\n\nThis unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE's\nfragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a\ndressing gown.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, please.  I don't enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one\nperson again, please?\n\nThe big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical\ngestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN I\nLaurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN II\n-- you would find it erotic.\n\nLAURIE\nAll right, all right.  It's just -- my nerves, I'm going stir-crazy\nin this place, I --\n\nWhile fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance\nthrough a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment,\nshe sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an\nexperiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through\nthe door . . .\n\n58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER\n. . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:\n\nLAURIE\nYou've been out here all along, haven't you?  Running one of your\nstupid experiments --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN III\nYes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.\n\nLAURIE\nSo you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how\ncould you do this?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN III\nYou seem to feel I've been neglecting you.  Isn't that the case?\n(pause)\nI thought I'd solved the problem quite elegantly.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's all it is to you, isn't it?  Just another problem you\ncan --\n\nShe doesn't see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered\nthe room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:\n\nDR. MANHATTANS I & II\nLaurie, please --\n\nLAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back\nslowly, steadies herself on a lab table.\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I\ncould really use the time alone.\n\nShe storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I &\nII -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original\nDR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his\nequipment.\n\nFADE THROUGH TO:\n\n1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nA pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard\nat work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly\nbeautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it's largely\nwasted on her preoccupied date.\n\nAt the moment, she's filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:\n\nLAURIE\nThe government's really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I\nguess it's no picnic being the world's only superhuman.\n(mock-macho)\nI have to keep him in line.\n\nShe flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to\nlaugh.  He doesn't.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has\nwandered off into a far corner of the room.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nExcuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?\n\nDREIBERG\nSorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think\nanyone's out to get us -- do you?\n\nLAURIE\nDan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no\nMother Teresa.\n\nDREIBERG\nPsychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .\n\nLAURIE\nNow wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the\ngovernment or do time.\n\nDREIBERG\nFine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty\ntricks -- political assassinations --\n\nNow he's got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then\nleans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:\n\nLAURIE\nOkay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us\nmade other choices.\n\nDREIBERG\n(shaking his head in disgust)\n\nYeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors\n. . . and I'm still in the psycho file with Rorschach.\n\nLAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nWhat's so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?\n\nLAURIE\nI'm just wondering what you would've said ten years ago if you could\nsee yourself right now.\n(raising her glass)\nWell, here's to the Comedian.  'Cause the fact is, he's dead . . .\nand we're not.\n\nDREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.\n\n1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace,\nwhich overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They're holding big snifters\nof brandy, and they're both pretty well drunk.\n\nDREIBERG\nThe pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I\nmean, we were heroes!\n\nLAURIE\nDamn straight.\n\nDREIBERG\nDamn straight!  We were heroes.\n\nLAURIE\nOf course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.\n\nDREIBERG\nWell, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the\nworld and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .\n\nLAURIE\n(smiling)\nHey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma?\nWhat was his name . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nOh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd\nbeat him up?\n\nLAURIE\nThat's the one.  Whatever happened to him?\n\nDREIBERG\n(deadpan)\nHe pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an\nelevator shaft.\n\nLAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to\nher mouth -- and like DREIBERG she's GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA\nPULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a\nstentorian VOICE over scene:\n\nCHAPLAIN (V.O.)\nIn the midst of life we are in death . . .\n\nCUT TO:\n\n59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY\nAN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.\n\nCHAPLAIN\n. . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall\nchange our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --\n\nTIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of\nmourners.  There's no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the\nattendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons\nof protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off\nwith the traditional twenty-one gun salute.\n\nCHAPLAIN (cont.)\n-- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all\nthings unto himself.\n\nA light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR.\nMANHATTAN, of course, doesn't need one -- the raindrops vanish\nmiraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the\ndistance, and he glances off at:\n\n60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT\nSENTRIES stand at attention.  They've blocked off the part of the\ncemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has\nbeen spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like\nwildfire.\n\nMOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the\ncemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due\nrespect for the dead, Arlington National's turning into a zoo:\ngawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their\nhands full managing the crowd.\n\nA KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to\njoin the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the\nVIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.\n\nIt's not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled\nmarble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward,\nand he's cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms,\nPieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze\nplaque bears the inscription:\n\nIN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS\nWHO GAVE THEIR LIVES\nTO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM\n\nBelow it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four\nhundred of them.\n\n61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\nThe Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE's home sweet\nhome.  Her car pulls up to the guard's booth and he waves her\nthrough.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind\nher, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.\n\n62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT\nLAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex,\nfumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the\ncard into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.\n\nShe tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls\nup behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps\nout.\n\nLAURIE\nMajor Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.\n\nADAMSON\nLaurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.\n\nLAURIE\nWhy?  What's the problem?\n\nADAMSON\nI can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.\n\nLAURIE\n(chuckling)\nI would like to use the bathroom --\n\nAs she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.\n\nADAMSON\nThe access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat?!\n\nADAMSON\nPlease.\n\nThe major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The\nGUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.\n\nADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE's climbing inside when she\nsees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.\n\nThe entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging\nfrom it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION\nSUITS.\n\n63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT\nLAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to\na team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard\nat the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white\ngown:\n\nNURSE\nMiss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat -- ?\n\nDOCTOR\nDrink this.\n\nThe DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She\nstares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.\n\nDOCTOR\nDrink it.\n\n64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT\nTECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are\nshifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of\na human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens\non:\n\n65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT\nWe're watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A\ndonut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot,\nfoot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to\nthe anteroom.\n\nThrough a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head\nwedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right\nas she wonders just what the hell is going on.\n\n66. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nA MAN'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.\n\nLAURIE (O.S.)\nThat's Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon's military liaison.\n\nLAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table\nsurrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent\nSCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken\nfrom a thick sheaf.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nDr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon's research teams.  The\nquantum-whatever.\n\nSCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It's a group shot of the\nWatchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE's closet.  LAURIE\nhesitates.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nThat's Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt.\n(long pause)\nRorschach . . .\n\nSCHMIDT\nTheir real names, please.\n\nLAURIE\nI don't know their real names.\n\nSCHMIDT\nYou're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.\n\nLAURIE\nI don't know their real names!\n\nSCHMIDT\nYou're not \"protecting\" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on\nthe answers you give.\n(holding up the sheaf of photos)\nThese are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --\n\nLAURIE\nThen why don't you ask him?!?\n\nFurious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby\nwindow.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced\ntorturers, they understand the value of patience.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nI want to get dressed.  -- And I'd like a cigarette.\n\nOne of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out\nfor LAURIE.  As he's lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door\nopens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.\n\nHe passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and\ntilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with\ncuriosity:\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nSomeone had better tell me what's going on here!\n\nSCHMIDT\nSit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file\nare all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else\nin common as well.\n(beat)\nThey've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?\n\nAll at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE's face goes\nbone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she\ntakes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she's read.\n\nSCHMIDT\nI'm terribly sorry.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat does this mean?  What does it --\n\nSCHMIDT\nSix to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can\nsee why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible\njoke to make me --\n\nShe scans the room.  No one's laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to\nhis comrades, and heads for the door.\n\nSCHMIDT\nTake a day or two.  If you \"remember\" any names . . . do give us a\ncall.\n\nThe AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches\nfor the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking,\nshe buries her face in her hands.\n\n67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nA darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a\ntwo-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who's been\nwatching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.\n\nADAMSON\nPoor kid.\n\nSCHMIDT\nWe'll keep her in isolation awhile.  She'll give us some names.\n\nADAMSON\nTo hell with those costumed idiots.  I'm worried about Doc\nManhattan.\n\nSCHMIDT\nWhat do you mean?\n\nADAMSON\nShe's his last link to humanity.  Once she's gone . . . God knows\nwhich way he'll jump.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY\nDR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He's wearing\na navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie\nwith an irregular mauve pattern.\n\nThe tie doesn't quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie\nmagically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal\ngold stripes.\n\nToo staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into\na handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for\ndecoration.\n\nIt does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the\nmirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.\n\n69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY\nTECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green\nroom, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.\n\nDIRECTOR\nWe're on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is\nthat big blue son of a --\n\nHe stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just\nrematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR's\nface.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm sorry.  Am I late?\n\nDIRECTOR\nNo problem.  We'll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I'm\nKent Turner, the director. . .\n\nThe DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN's hand and marches him down a\nhallway.  Within seconds they're joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.\n\nLIAISON\nDr. Osterman.  I've got a list of taboo areas here we'd like you to\nsteer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you'll\njust play it cool --\n\nDIRECTOR\nDoc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give\nus something a little darker . . . ?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWill this do?\n\nDIRECTOR\nPerfect.\n\nLIAISON\nNow Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --\n\nBut the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by\na cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are\nhurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON\nhangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The \"ABC NEWS\nSPECIAL REPORT\" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC\nunderneath.\n\n70. INSERT - TV MONITOR\nStock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for\ntheir lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right\nand takes in an extraordinary sight.\n\nA towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through\nthe jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the\ngreenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts\nof automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation\ncrew does his apocalypse thing.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads:\n\"VIETNAM.  1965.\"\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O.)\nDr. Manhattan: the nuclear titan spawned in a freak scientific\nmishap.  For more than twenty years the \"Manhattan Option\" has been\nthe linchpin of America's conventional strategy --\n\nWe CUT to PRAGUE, where RUSSIAN TANKS are rolling through a broad\nthoroughfare.  DR. MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds\na corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.\n\nHis EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey\ngunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM\nhisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met\nwith a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads:\n\"CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968.\"\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)\n-- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a\none-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding\nthe Communist menace in check.\n\nDANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from\nAmerican Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake\nhands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a\nthree-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic\naccord.  Title: \"NICARAGUA.  1979.\"\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)\nIn the famous words of General William Westmoreland, \"Yes, Virginia,\nthere is a Superman -- and thank God, he's American.\"\n\n71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nA sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop\nof the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded\nnews vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host's chair:\n\nBRINKLEY\nFor this live question-and-answer session we'll be joined by\ncorrespondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating,\nI'll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy.\n(turning)\nNow let's welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better\nknown to the world as Dr. Manhattan.\n\nApplause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at\nBRINKLEY's right.  He nods in acknowledgement.\n\nBRINKLEY (cont.)\nI suppose the topic on everyone's mind this week is Afghanistan,\nwhere Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now\nsince you've dealt successfully with similar situations in the past .\n. . I'll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that\nyou intervene?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI will not intervene in Afghanistan.\n\nA HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.\n\n72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\nLooking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.\n\n73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN\nHANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience.\nBRINKLEY ignores them:\n\nBRINKLEY\nYou're saying you would refuse a direct request?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThere will be no request.  I will not intervene.\n\nBRINKLEY\nWell, Doctor, it's widely understood, or rumored, that you can\nactually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the\nhostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?\n\n74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\nHe's steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he's hanging on\nDR. MANHATTAN's every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE\nin the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:\n\nLIAISON\nI want a phone line to the booth.  Now.\n\n75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it.\n(long pause)\nI can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will\nnot intervene.\n\nHe sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.\n\nBRINKLEY\nWell, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I'll\nopen up the floor to questions now.  Doug?\n\nREPORTER\nDr. Osterman, I'm Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I'd like to read\nyou some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M.\nWeaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nAll friends, yes.  Associates of mine.\n\nROTH\nLet me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White.\nAre you aware that these \"friends\" and \"associates\" of yours have all\nbeen diagnosed with terminal cancer?\n\nThe CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY's taken aback.  He\ngapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face\nan unreadable mask.\n\n76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\neyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone\n\nLIAISON\nOh Jesus.\n(barking into phone)\nI want this broadcast killed.  I'll run out on that goddamn set if I\nhave to!\n\n77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN\nROTH\nI have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly\ndiagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a\nconnection?\n\nBy now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make\nhimself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who's just gotten a message\nfrom the booth, touches his headset and announces:\n\nBRINKLEY\nI'm told it's time for a break.  We'll be back after this brief\nmessage --\n\nWithin seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set,\nflanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.\n\nLIAISON\nTHAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW'S OVER!!\n\nThe three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then,\nPANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB\nTHE SET.\n\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\nDr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause\ncancer??\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI don't wish to answer any questions.\n\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\nYou see the future!  Did you know in advance --\n\nLIAISON\nThe Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP\nASIDE!!\n\nThe LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but\nthe mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.\n\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\nHow long have you known -- why is the government concealing this\ninformation --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nPlease get out of my way.\n\nThe LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor.\nSCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it's getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN\nlets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI said LEAVE ME ALONE!!\n\nIn the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no\nmicrophones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR.\nMANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.\n\nBRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later,\nthere's an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES,\nleaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT\nThe place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is\noverseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post\nquarantine notices at the entrances.  He's not altogether surprised\nwhen DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWhere's Laurie?\n\nADAMSON backs off slightly.  He's not wearing a radiation suit, and\nhe's understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely\nnecessary.\n\nADAMSON\nShe's been relocated, Jon.  It's strictly precautionary . . .\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThere's no need to lie.  I assume she's been tested.  Were the\nresults positive?\n\nADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\nDon't bother.  I already know what you'll say.\n\nHe watches impassively as what's left of his home is dismantled.  His\nmind is already a million miles away.\n\nADAMSON\nJon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . .\ncould you cure her?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI don't know.  I only know that I won't.\n(long pause)\nThere'd be no point.  It's finally begun.\n\nADAMSON\n\"Begun?\"  What's begun?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI've seen this day.  It's the day I've been dreading all these years.\n(pause)\nYou see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I\ncared for . . .\n\nADAMSON doesn't know what he's talking about, but a chill runs down\nhis spine nonetheless.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nMy work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.\n\nAnd with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves\nbehind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at\nthe Major's feet.\n\nADAMSON\nGood Lord --\n\nCUT TO:\n\n79. EXT. OUTER SPACE\n-- and it's about as exterior as you can get.  We're a few\nhundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily\napparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily\nbeautiful\n-- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white\nclouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing\nour planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.\n\nIt's DR. MANHATTAN.  He's in a lotus position, sitting on\nnothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage.\nStars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he's about to\nleave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.\n\n80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT\nBlack sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so\nbarren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is,\nuntil we see the residue of man's presence on the landscape: ruined\nquonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements,\nhalf-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than\nhusks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a\nrotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.\n\nA gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden\nRUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue\nlight.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift\nin the sky and descends gently to earth.\n\nThe rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once\nmore as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town\nof Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was\nonce a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long\nmahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.\n\nA desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We\nMOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY\nIt's twenty-odd years ago, and we're looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN\n-- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie\nand a white lab coat.  He's at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing\na dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:\n\nJANEY SLATER (O.S.)\nNineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You'd think they\ncould at least make us a decent hamburger.\n\nJON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He's utterly smitten\nwith DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she's a couple\nof years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just\nclose enough to LAURIE that you'd notice the resemblance.  And she's\nprobably the only one in the room who can't see just how bad a crush\nJON has on her.\n\nJON\nI'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna\nhead straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.\n\nJANEY\nWith lots of ketchup?\n\nSmiling, she indicates JON's plate.  He's emptied at least half a\nbottle on his french fries.\n\nJON\nNothing wrong with ketchup.\n\nJANEY\nJon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug\nlike you doing in a place like this?\n\nJON\nAnything for science, I guess.\n(long, hesitant pause)\nJaney, there's something --\n\nJANEY\n(simultaneously)\nWe should get back --\n(realizing she's cut him off)\nWhat?\n\nJON\nNothing.  What were you going to say?\n\nJANEY\nWe should get back to the lab.\n(staring at him; chuckling)\nYou okay, Jon?\n\nHe stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he\npipes up:\n\nJON\nOh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I'll be right behind you.\n\nThe lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads\nfor the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after\nJANEY.  She's paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.\n\nHis face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up\nbehind her.\n\nJANEY\nStupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --\n\nJON\n(blurting it out)\nJaney, will you marry me?\n\nShe turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He's wearing the\npained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the\nverdict.\n\nJANEY\nJon -- what?\n\nJON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes\nlocked.  For a moment it's as if they're the only souls in the\ncanteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the\ndoor, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and\none of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled\nJANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.\n\nThere's a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private\ntrance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.\n\nWALLY\nChrist, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.\n\nJANEY\nOh Wally, don't feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --\n\nJON\nI can fix it.\n\nJANEY\n-- What?\n\nJON\nMy dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better\nthan ever.\n\nHe holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.\n\nWALLY\nTake him up on it.  It'd make me feel better.\n\nChuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY\nhands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her\nwith basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he's still waiting for his\nanswer.\n\nBut before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket.\nHe thrusts it abruptly into JANEY's hands --\n\nJON\nHere.  I'll trade you.\n\n-- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING.\nWith a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but\nhe's already gone.\n\nShe stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.\n\n82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY\nJON's at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center\nof the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER'S\nTOOLS.\n\nIt's his lunch hour, and he's fixing JANEY's watch.  He tightens the\ncentral screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal\ninto its housing and gives it a light tap.\n\nWith a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy's in love,\nremember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed\nwith oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST\nCHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of\nit are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like\nanti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.\n\nHe stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and\nwalks over to grab it.  As he's putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK\nfrom the direction of the test chamber.\n\nMounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes,\nseconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it's 13:58 and change.  JON\neyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to\nthe reinforced steel door of the chamber.\n\nInside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a\nlow platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it\nhears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY's watch on the\nconcrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.\n\nJON\nC'mon, little guy, outta here . . .\n\nThe mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in\nhand.\n\nJON (cont.)\n. . . don't wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.\n\nHe stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he's left the watch\ninside.\n\nHe looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting.\nAgitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the\ndoorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of\nthe concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete\nblock, reaches for the watch --\n\n-- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.\n\nWhite-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete\nblock -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of\nthe support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.\n\nBefore his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place --\nTRAPPING HIM INSIDE.\n\nHe LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps\nsliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams\nshut.\n\n83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT\n1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One\nof them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of\nMILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the\nfacilities.\n\nSCIENTIST\n-- actually, we don't know what happens when you disrupt the\nintrinsic field.  All we've managed to do so far is blow a few\nconcrete blocks all to hell.\n\nGENERAL\n(joking, but worried)\nNo danger of . . . fallout, is there?\n\nSCIENTIST\nNo sir.  The chamber's radiation-proof once it's sealed.  That's why\nwe waited outside.\n\nThe translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a\ndull red.\n\nThe crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There's a dim, distant\nTHUMPING.\n\nThe SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect\nunison.\n\nGENERAL\nWhat's the matter?\n\nSCIENTIST\nSweet Jesus -- !\n\nWe DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of\nthe test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the\nterrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass,\nscreaming soundlessly.\n\nPandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left,\npunching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes\nto a belated and painfully obvious realization:\n\nGENERAL\nSay, there's a man in there!!\n\nThe coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One\nSCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --\n\nSCIENTIST I\nStay calm, Jon!  We'll try and kill the power!\n\n-- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:\n\nSCIENTIST II\nBuilding six!  Kill the power!  Osterman's trapped in the I.F.\nchamber!!\n\nThe GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.\n\nGENERAL\nWell -- why doesn't someone let him out??\n\nSCIENTIST III\nIt's a timelock.  It can't be opened once the sequence\nstarts.\n(to SCIENTIST II)\nWhat's the word?\n\nSCIENTIST II\n(covering the phone)\nThey're sending a crew to the generator building --\n\nSCIENTIST IV\nTWENTY SECONDS!\n\nIn a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions \"IN\nCASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS.\"  WALLY WEAVER, Jon's friend from the\ncanteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the\nglass, and grabs the ax.\n\nSCIENTIST I\nWally!  What are you doing?\n\nWALLY\nThe power cables!!\n\nAnd now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY\nSLATER.\n\nJANEY\nAm I late for the --\n\nShe stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the\nlab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back\nthrough the door.\n\nSCIENTIST III\nJaney!  Get her out of here.  Get out!\n\nBut she resists.  She's just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to\ntake a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils\nhave just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.\n\nJANEY\nWhat in the name of -- where's Jon?\n\nSCIENTIST III\nJaney!  Please!  Go!!\n\nWALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a\nsudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a\nwall.\n\nSparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white\nlight.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look\nat the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.\n\nJANEY\nJon.\n\n84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\nJON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his\nface.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch,\nwhich he's been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters .\n. .\n\n. . . and everything in the room goes blue.\n\n85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT\nThe SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to\ntear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind\nthem.\n\nJANEY\nJon . . .\n(shrieking)\nJON!!!\n\n86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\nJON's back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of\nunbelievable agony.\n\nA moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a\nphotographic negative -- stands in his place.\n\nThen the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The\niridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to\npieces.\n\nAnd then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim,\nand we're looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of\nthe SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY,\nwho gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT\nThe desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall\nbehind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago\nat 11:48 PM.\n\nFor a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches\nthe rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the\ndoor of the canteen.\n\n88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.\n\n89. INT. MEN'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\nTWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into\nthe mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous\nthing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal\ncord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous\nsystem.\n\nThey pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in\na haze of shimmering blue light.\n\n90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.\n\n91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\nHORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A\npartially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS\nfor several seconds before vanishing altogether.\n\n92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.\n\n93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\nDinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.\n\nJANEY\nI can't help it.  I'm going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it\nfeels haunted.\n\nWALLY\nIt'll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that's all.\n(tugging at his ear)\nDo you hear some kind of -- whistling?\n\nIndeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine.\nOdder yet, WALLY's hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY's.\nEveryone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish\nphenomenon.\n\nUTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without\nwarning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW\nsuffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .\n\n. . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them,\nnude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and\nutensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.\n\nJANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go\nto her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.\n\nJANEY\nJON-N-N-N!!!\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nTHE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns,\nstares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and\nbegins to dig.\n\nA couple of inches down, he finds what he's looking for: an ancient,\ntattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and\nJaney Slater.  She's holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new\nengagement ring.\n\nHis fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.\n\n95. SERIES OF SHOTS\nQuick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:\n\n-- JON's black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;\n\n-- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue\nlight;\n\n-- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper.\nThere's a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a\nterrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .\n\n-- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom\ncloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.\n\n96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN\nFists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in\nthe ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at\nfirst, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue\nstarburst a mile above the ground.\n\n97. EXT. OUTER SPACE\nAll at once, we're back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth\nat unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on\ntoward Mars.\n\nThe red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame\nas we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface.\nIndividual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct:\nvast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri.\nHerschel's famous canali.  And finally, the argyre\nplanitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling\ntwo jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular\nridge.\n\nTwo eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a\nhappy-face.\n\nMany miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian\natmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we\n\nCUT TO:\n\n98. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN\nThe late news, with highlights of DR. MANHATTAN's press conference.\nAs the throng of REPORTERS shove microphones at him, we ZOOM IN on\nhis angered face:\n\nDR.

MANHATTAN is gone -- and they're all standing on\nthe White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.\n\nPULL BACK TO:\n\n99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT\nA restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair.\nShe's in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the\nbig metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy\nfurnished studio.\n\nTV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)\n-- in Washington, where an irate Dr. Manhattan teleported\na crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania\nAvenue!\n\nTV ANCHORMAN (O.S.)\nWell, Katie, I know some politicians who'd like to learn that trick --\n\nLAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.

Let's move\nit.\n\nLAURIE\n(fed up; exploding)\nI don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit\n--\n\nSCHMIDT\nOh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan\nborder this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living\nsoul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic\nweapons has finally flipped out.\n\nLAURIE\nJon??  You mean he's --\n\nSCHMIDT\nThat's right.

A\nDRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight\nWOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and\noff as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging\ntipsy giggles.\n\n102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT\nA three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.

The\ncontents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen\nfloor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It's a\ndisaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in\nthe doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.\n\nLUCY\nJeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?\n\nOn cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH.\nHe grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen\ntable.\n\nRORSCHACH\nMoloch.  Did you miss me?\n\nLUCY\nWillie!  Jesus!  What's going on?\n\nRORSCHACH\n(glancing up)\nWho's the welfare mother?\n\nMOLOCH\nI don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong\nguy.\n\nRORSCHACH\nEdgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.\n\nMOLOCH\nYou're making a big --\n\nRORSCHACH lifts MOLOCH up slightly, then slams him down hard against\nthe table -- repeatedly, to the beat.\n\nRORSCHACH\nTerrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.\n\nMOLOCH\nALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?\n\nLUCY\nWillie, what's he talking about?\n\nRORSCHACH backs off, allowing MOLOCH to slump to the floor.\nRORSCHACH kneels beside him.\n\nMOLOCH\nLook, I don't know what you want, but I been a private citizen for\nten years.  I --\n\nRORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH's chin and pulls him\nclose.  Then, for LUCY's benefit, he explains:\n\nRORSCHACH\nTurned state's witness in '75.  Earned himself a brand-new face.\n(twisting MOLOCH's head to one side, for a better look)\nHnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.\n\nHe shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There's a sugar\nbowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as\nMOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nComedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who's\nbehind it?\n\nMOLOCH\nRorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with\n--\n\nRORSCHACH\nWorked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.\n\nMOLOCH\nCTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --\n\nRORSCHACH\nDon't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.\n\nLUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH's side and grips his arm as\nRORSCHACH opens a rear window.  He's climbing through the frame when\nhe stops suddenly and points a finger at the frightened pair:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nWord of advice for the lady . . . stock up on penicillin.\n\n-- and he's out on the fire escape and GONE.  LUCY looks suspiciously\nat MOLOCH, who shrugs, embarrassed: I don't know what he's talking\nabout.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n104. INT. PENTAGON - WAR ROOM - DAY\nThe familiar set from Dr. Strangelove: top brass seated at a\nbig round table, with a huge Mercator-projection map of the world\nlooming in BG.  The Afghan-Pakistani border is highlighted in red; a\nMILITARY ANALYST paces in front of the big board with a penlight\nPOINTER,\nhighlighting areas of strategic importance.\n\nANALYST\nOur projections show Pakistan falling within the week.  From there\nit's sixty percent certain they'll try to take Western Europe.\n\nGENERAL\nRespectfully, sir, out NATO allies are getting itchy.  They're\nquizzing us about the possibility of a first strike.\n\nMOVE IN on a tall chair at the head of the table -- the back of which\nbears the seal of the President of the United States.\n\nPRESIDENT\nFirst strike.\n(long pause)\nI'd like to view the simulation.\n\nThe ANALYST hits a button on a remote control device.\n\nANALYST\nOptimally . . . we could expect to wipe out some eighty percent of\ntheir retaliatory capability before they knew what hit 'em.\n\nOn the big board, BLUE ARROWS emanate from selected points in the\nPacific and the Arctic Circle and veer toward Russian turf --\nblossoming in yellow-and-black RADIATION\nSYMBOLS as they strike their targets.\n\nPRESIDENT\nWhat about our end?\n\nANALYST\nWell, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that\ntwenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.\n\nOn the board, RED ARROWS inch westward from Mother Russia.\n\nANALYST (cont.)\nBritain down -- Germany down --\n\nPRESIDENT\nWhat kind of time frame are we talking about?\n\nANALYST\nThirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified\ncommand bunker at the time of the launch order.\n\nRADIATION SYMBOLS sprout over New York, Baltimore, Washington,\nDenver, Los Angeles, San Francisco.\n\nPRESIDENT\n. . . Of course.\n\nBy now, both coasts are pretty well blotted out.  The ANALYST, a\ndedicated optimist, turns to announce:\n\nANALYST\nAs you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the\nfarm belt.\n\nPRESIDENT\nWhat about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . \"nuclear winter\"\ntheory?\n\nANALYST\nWe don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . .\nmay depend on a quirk of the weather.\n\nPRESIDENT\nThe weather.  I see.\n(pause)\nKeep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum\nstrike conditions.\n\nThe SECRETARY OF STATE -- our old pal G. Gordon Liddy -- pipes up:\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY\nDick, before we act hastily, we should consider . . . Dr. Manhattan\nmay decide to return.\n\nWith a heavy heart, the Chief Executive pushes himself away from the\ntable -- and we get our first good look at him.  His face is lined\nand tired, his hair is flecked with white, but he's none other than\nthat beloved statesman RICHARD M. NIXON -- still vital and robust at\n74.\n\nPRESIDENT (cont.)\nGood God.  At times like this I wish I'd never come out of\nretirement.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n105. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY\nA private practice in midtown Manhattan.  LAURIE emerges from an\nexamination room, grim and hollow-eyed; the DOCTOR hangs back in the\ndoorway.\n\nDOCTOR\nI'm sorry, Miss Juspecyzk.\n\nLAURIE\nNot at all, Doctor.  I appreciate your honesty.\n\n106. INT. GUNGA DINER - DUSK\nA greasy Indian restaurant in a Village storefront.  In a booth near\nthe entrance we find LAURIE and DREIBERG munching on chicken\ntandoori.\n\nDREIBERG\nChrist yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a\ncouple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .\n(pause)\nHow about you, Laurie?\n\nLAURIE\n(lying -- with forced cheer)\nOh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the\nhell out.\n(shrugging)\nNo expense account.  No place to live.\n\nDREIBERG\nYou'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each\nother, someone might put two and two together . . .\n\nLAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.\n\nLAURIE\nThey're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're\nright on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the\nWatchmen.\n\nDREIBERG\nMaybe not, but why take chances?\n\nLAURIE\nDan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent\nall these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel --\nI feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own\nlife, and --\n\n-- and she's dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a\ndamper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts\nto get up.\n\nLAURIE\nI'm just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I'd better go find\nmyself a cheap room.\n\nDREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the\ndoor of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and\nchases her down:\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . .\n.\nLAURIE\nOh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --\n\nDREIBERG\nNo, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely\nright.  -- I'd love to have you stay.\n\nLAURIE\nYou're sure?\n\nHe nods.  She smiles and takes his arm as they walk out of the\nrestaurant.\n\nTHROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the\nstreet outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of\nframe, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of\nketchup.\n\nHe inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down\nquestion mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he\nopens it again, he's got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.\n\n107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET\nA SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant,\nthen disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls\ncasually down the alleyway.\n\nHe moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the\ncrumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a\nsmall recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a\nshifting INKBLOT MASK.\n\n108. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nThe guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style:\nflowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc.\nIt's small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative \"aah\" as\nDREIBERG ushers her in.\n\nLAURIE\nThis is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.\n\nDREIBERG's lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands\nthere for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nAre you . . . waiting for a tip?\n\nDREIBERG\nOh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I\nmean, if you need some aspirin, or --\n\nLAURIE\nI'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really\nsweet.  Sleep tight, okay?\n\nShe gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek, then returns to her\nunpacking.  DREIBERG watches her for a second, then turns to go.\n\n109. INT. HALLWAY - ON DREIBERG\nAs he closes the door, he get a quick glimpse, from behind, of LAURIE\nunbuttoning her shirt.  He quickly averts his gaze and pulls the door\nshut.\n\n110. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\nDREIBERG, in pajamas, climbs into bed and kills the light.  He folds\nhis hands behind his head and stares up at the ceiling.\n\n111. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE\nAnother quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it's SILK SPECTRE --\nLAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off\nvaliantly, but she's heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.\n\nAn oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into\nframe; he's clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP\noverhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE's path and\nsnatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.\n\n112. INT. BEDROOM - ON DREIBERG.\nHis head turns at the sound of WATER running in the bathroom\nadjacent.  He's going to be awake half the night thinking of\nLAURIE.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n113. EXT. STREET - DAY\nEarly morning.  Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in\nan alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and\ncrewcut.  He's got a definite CTU look about him.\n\nMOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA\nDINER.\n\n114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nA twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and\npulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the\nnose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges\nof his EYELIDS.\n\nHis eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper;\nbizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it\nup . . .\n\nThere's a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.\n\nA low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and\nsees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.\n\nHe GASPS and lunges for the door.  RORSCHACH's arm snakes out and\nholds the stall door shut.\n\nRORSCHACH\nTwo things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational\ndrugs.\n\nMOLOCH\nNo, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got\nsomething for you.\n\nA long pause.  RORSCHACH GROWLS again: let's have it.\n\nMOLOCH (cont.)\nThere's a big bunch of research scientists -- missing.  Blake was on\na case, trying to track 'em down.\n(beat)\nIt's big, Rorschach.  Something to do with Doc Manhattan.  That's all\nI've been able to find out.\n\nRORSCHACH\nDrug habit.  Highly illegal.  Hnrrh.\n(snarling)\nLet it go time.  In future -- just say no.\n\nWith that he disappears over the edge of the stall.  MOLOCH sits\nthere a moment.  He reaches for the stall door, rattles it.  It won't\nopen.\n\nMOLOCH\nHEY!!\n\nRORSCHACH's stuck a broomstick through the door handles on the\nadjacent stalls. As MOLOCH POUNDS on the door in frustration, we\n\nCUT TO:\n\n115. INT. VEIDT'S PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY\nA plush RECEPTION ROOM in his Veidt Industries pyramid; it's\ndecorated in the same Egyptian motifs as his office.  VEIDT sits in\nan overstuffed chair, surrounded by VIDEO CAMERAS; he's in the\nprocess of charming JUSTINE JAMES, a fawning Barbara Walters-figure\nwho's prepping a segment for her next celebrity-chat special.\n\nJUSTINE\nNow Adrian, I guess there's one thing everyone wants to know.\nAre you the world's smartest man?\n\nVEIDT\nOh my, yes.  And the best-dressed.\n\nA round of chuckles from the video CREW.  Wotta smoothie!\n\nJUSTINE\nYou're certainly one of the richest.  Holder of over forty\nbasic patents -- including products that have changed our everyday\nlives.\n(pause)\nIf you had one achievement you were proudest of -- what would that be?\n\nVEIDT ponders for a second, then reaches into his jacket and pulls\nout his gold cigarette case.\n\nVEIDT\nSphinx brand.\n(opening the case)\nWhen I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . .\nhumanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good\nin the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco,\nthat no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs\nas you smoke it?\n(lighting up)\nIn fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?\n\nJUSTINE\nThanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your\nold colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --\n\nVEIDT\n(bristling)\nNo.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the\nWatchmen.\n\nJUSTINE\nOh sweetheart, just a quick one.\n\nVEIDT\nNo.  We laid out very careful ground rules --\n\nVEIDT is interrupted by a GROWLING NOISE from his office adjacent.\nHe glances quickly over his shoulder, then gets back to business.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\n-- we agreed specifically --\n\nMORE GROWLING from the next room over.  The CAMERA CREW's getting\ncurious.  VEIDT gets up from his chair.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nExcuse me a second.\n\nHe goes to the office door and slips inside.  The usually-smiley\nJUSTINE shoots a look of disgust at her CREW: what a prick.\n\n116. INT. VEIDT'S OFFICE - DAY\nVEIDT is shocked to find RORSCHACH down on the carpet, wrestling with\nhis mutant LYNX.  He CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE:\n\nVEIDT\nKITTY!!\n\nOne last nip, and the cat backs off.  RORSCHACH gets to his feet --\nno visible signs of damage, except for a severe bruise to his\ndignity.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nHow the hell did you get in here?\n\nThe curtains are flapping; a BREEZE hits VEIDT across the face.  He\nlooks up, sees a NEAT ROUND HOLE cut out of his plate-glass\nwindow.\n\nRORSCHACH\nNew information.\n\nVEIDT\n(pointing to the telephone)\nEver see one of these before?\n\nRORSCHACH\nToo important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked\nup.\n\nVEIDT\nWhat is that ungodly smell?\n\nRORSCHACH, abashed, lets out a timid version of his trademark\nHISS.\n\nRORSCHACH\nBigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .\n\nVEIDT\nYeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a\nroomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.\n(beat)\nAnd whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us\nall look bad.\n\nRORSCHACH\nFate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad\npress.\n\nHe makes for the window.  VEIDT frowns, adjusts his tie and exits.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n117. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE cooking dinner.  DREIBERG burns his fingers on a\nbroiling pan, which prompts a sudden round of stamping and\ncursing.\n\nLAURIE watches for a minute, then shakes her head.  She pours a full\nglass of wine and thrusts it at him.\n\nLAURIE\nDaniel -- drink this.  Immediately.\n(smiling)\nI swear, you are acting like a kid on a date.\n\nSucking on his burnt fingers, he reluctantly takes the wineglass.\n\nDREIBERG\nOkay, I'm nervous.  It's an odd sensation.  I've always had to think\nof you as Dr. Manhattan's --\n\nHe catches himself -- too late.  LAURIE glowers at him.\n\nLAURIE\nHis what?\n\nDREIBERG\nHis . . . whatever.\n\nLAURIE\nI'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?\n\nShe spears a couple of steaks, drops them on plates, and heads toward\nthe dining room.\n\nLAURIE\nLook, I just want to eat dinner and get drunk.  Let's not make it any\nmore difficult than we have to, huh?\n\n118.

DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nA DINING ROOM TABLE littered with crumpled napkins and dirty\ndishes.  DREIBERG and LAURIE have just finished dinner.  He stares in\ndismay at the TV screen as he opens a fresh bottle of wine.\n\nDREIBERG\nGood Lord.  With Jon out of the picture it's a whole new ball\ngame.\n\nLAURIE's already a little tipsy, and the broadcast doesn't much\ninterest her.  Wine glass in hand, she's wandered over to the stereo\ncabinet.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's right, Daniel.  A whole new ball game.\n(smiling)\nGod!  I haven't seen on of these in fifteen years.\n\nShe's referring to DREIBERG's ancient TURNTABLE.  Shelved beneath it\nare row upon row of LP's -- these days, they're obsolete collector's\nitems.\n\nDREIBERG\nI told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I\nlisten to -- it never came out on crystal.\n\nLAURIE\nI'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.\n(flipping through records)\nNellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these\npeople.\n\nDREIBERG\nPlay one.  Educate yourself.\n\nLAURIE chuckles.  Her head turns at the sound of a familiar\nCOMMERCIAL THEME.  On the TV, a young woman sits at her vanity and\ngazes lovingly at a WEDDING PICTURE framed in silver.\n\nLAURIE\nOh look.  It's Adrian's ad.\n\nTV CHORUS\n\"Oh my darling, it's incredible,\nThat someone so unforgettable . . .\"\n\n120. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT\nMOLOCH's apartment.  THE SAME COMMERCIAL is blaring from the TV as\nRORSCHACH lets himself in.\n\nTV CHORUS\n\". . . Should think I am unforgettable too.\"\n\nRORSCHACH\nMoloch?\n\nNo reply from MOLOCH, who sits in an easy chair, his back to camera,\nseemingly glued to the tube.  RORSCHACH casts a cautious glance\naround the room and advances stealthily toward the chair.  Onscreen,\nthe WOMAN at the vanity opens a jar and smear LIME-GREEN GOO on her\nface:\n\nTV ANNOUNCER\nThe years melt away with NOSTALGIA.  Use it once a week -- and\nwrinkles vanish overnight.  Medically tested, non-habit-forming\nNOSTALGIA is the patented beauty cream that actually reverses\nthe aging process . . .\n\nRORSCHACH\nMoloch?\n\nHe creeps up behind MOLOCH, lays a hand on his shoulder.\n\n121. REVERSE ANGLE - ON MOLOCH\nstaring at the TV screen with sightless eyes.  There's a NEAT ROUND\nBULLET-HOLE in the center of his forehead.  RORSCHACH sees it and\nspins on his heels, anticipating an ambush --\n\nTV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)\nFor the smooth young face he'll never forget --\n\n122. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nLAURIE is still flipping through records.  DREIBERG chuckles at the\nTV ad.\n\nTV ANNOUNCER\n-- turn back the clock with NOSTALGIA . . . from Veidt Industries.\n\nDREIBERG\nNo wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?\n\nLAURIE\nSure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm\nthirty-eight years old!\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide\nit?\n\nLAURIE\nI like the way you look.\n(beat)\nIt's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change.\nBut you, Daniel, you look . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nOld?\n\nLAURIE\nNot at all.  You look very -- dashing.\n(standing up)\nHere, you pick one.\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . What?\n\nLAURIE\nPick a record.  I feel like dancing.\n\nHer tone is unmistakably flirtatious.  DREIBERG hesitates -- then,\nwith a noncommittal smile, he moves to the record cabinet.\n\n123. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH making a hasty exit.  An AMPLIFIED VOICE booms out:\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nRORSCHACH!  THIS IS THE CIVIL TERRORISM UNIT.  YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO\nCOME OUT.\n\nHe goes to the window and peeks through the blinds.  On the street\noutside, BUBBLE CARS are massing, blocking off the intersection.  A\nCTU SWAT TEAM prepares to raid the building.\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nYOU WON'T BE HARMED.  COME OUT.  IT'S ALL OVER!\n\nHe's walked into a trap.  As he lets the blinds fall, ALL SOUND DIES\n-- and a bouncy, tinkling PIANO THEME comes up underneath.\n\n124. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nThe PIANO MUSIC emanates from DREIBERG's stereo: an old Fats Waller\ntune, \"S'posin'.\"  He's slow dancing with LAURIE, their faces\nilluminated by the cold blue flicker of the television.  With a smile\nshe reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt\npocket.\n\nDreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making\nhim nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her\nhands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so\nthat he can't avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on\nhis mouth.\n\nThe PIANO INTRO ends, and Fats' teasing vocal begins:\n\n\"S'posin' I should fall in love with you . . .\nDo you think that you could love me too . . .\"\n\n125. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)\nSONG CONTINUES UNDERNEATH, cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a\nhorrific silent movie.  RORSCHACH races out of the bathroom carrying\na plastic MOP BUCKET, plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans --\nordinary household supplies.  He enters the kitchen, rummages around\nunder the sink, finds another handful of bottles: cleaning fluid,\nrubbing alcohol, Drano.\n\nAlmost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove, turns on all the\nburners -- and BLOWS OUT THE FLAMES.\n\n\"S'posin' I should hug you and caress you . . .\nWould it impress you . . .\"\n\n126.

The CTU COPS are pounding on the\nfront door, trying to break it down.  RORSCHACH crouches in the\nhallway just outside the living room.\n\nThe door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH\nstrikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN --\ncreating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the\npuddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF\nBOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.\n\n\"S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .\n(Yeah I yearn.  Sure I do.)\nWould you think I'm speaking out of turn? . . .\"\n\n128. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE horizontal on the sofa, their clothes in\ndisarray.  LAURIE kisses him hungrily -- but he's distant, panicky,\nunable to respond.  It's been a long time for him.  It's not going\nwell.\n\n\"S'posin' I declare it\nWould you take my love and share it?\nI'm not s'posin', I'm in love with you . . .\"\n\nHe wriggles beneath her.  She takes his hand, presses it onto her\nbreast.\n\n129. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)\nINSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE continues UNDERNEATH as RORSCHACH backs through\nthe kitchen with his bucket.  SMOKE billows in from the living room.\n\nHe empties TWO BOTTLES OF COOKING OIL on the linoleum floor.  Then he\nducks through a door into the BACK STAIRWELL.\n\n130. INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)\nRORSCHACH opens a bottle of CLEANING FLUID, stuffs a wad of newspaper\ninto its neck.  The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from\nthe smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov\ncocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.\n\nThe COPS pitch backward as the bottle blows up.  By the time they hit\nthe floor, the COOKING OIL has burst into flame.\n\nRORSCHACH bolts up the stairs; by now, another squad of CTU MEN is\ncoming up with back way behind him.\n\n131. INT.

Finally he can't stand it\nanymore -- and with a pained, stricken look he pushes her away and\nsits up on the sofa.  His head sinks into his hands.  At first she\ndoesn't understand; then her face softens, and she moves to his side,\nembracing his shoulders, gently stroking his hair.\n\n\". . . Or would it distress you?\"\n\n134. INT. TENEMENT - BACK STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)\nRORSCHACH huddled on the uppermost landing, just below roof level.\nBy now the whole building is ablaze.  Two flights down, a pair of CTU\nCOPS are fighting their way through the inferno, still on his tail.\n\nHe still has his mop bucket; it's half-full of water.  He reaches for\nhis last can -- a can of DRANO -- and empties it into the bucket,\nwhere it begins to HISS and SIZZLE.\n\n\"S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .\nWould you think I'm speaking out of turn . . .\"\n\nThe COPS are almost on him, racing upward two steps at a time.  He\nsteps out in front of them, and -- before they can hoist their\nweapons -- HEAVES THE BUCKETFUL OF BOILING DRANO into their faces.\n\nThe COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as\nRORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof.\n\n135. EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH emerges -- and a BLINDING LIGHT catches him full in the\nface.  Hovering not twenty feet overhead is a POLICE AIRSHIP -- a\nblimp-like craft of the sort we saw earlier.  A spray of MACHINE-GUN\nFIRE peppers the roof.\n\n\"S'posin' I declare it.\nWould you take my love and share it? . . .\"\n\nRORSCHACH scuttles along the edge of the roof, finds a rickety FIRE\nESCAPE, and dives over.  Unfortunately, he's now exposed on the front\nof the building -- pinned to the wall by gunfire from the SWAT TEAM on\nthe street.  TONGUES OF FLAME dart from nearby windows.  He turns and\ntries to climb back upward, but more COPS -- frm the just-landed\nAIRSHIP -- are already spilling over the edge of the roof.\n\n\"I ain't s'posin', I'm in love with you.\"\n\nThe song ends.  And on the last note, RORSCHACH emits an ungodly HOWL\nOF FURY -- diving over the metal railing, PLUNGING to the street\nbelow.\n\n136. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT\nThree stories down, he crashes into a cluster of garbage cans -- and\nlies there, spent, twisted, wracked with pain.  The CTU COPS are on\nhim instantly, kicking him, pummeling him with billy clubs and rifle\nbutts.\n\nCOPS\nGET HIM!  GET HIS MASK!  LET'S SEE THE LITTLE FUCKER'S FACE!!\n\nRORSCHACH\nGNAAAAHH!!  NO!! NO!!\n\nIn seconds the inkblot mask is off -- revealing a pocked, doughy face\ntopped off with a shock of MATTED RED HAIR.  It's a familiar\nface . . . the face of the STREET CRAZY who haunts the newsstand\nwith his placards announcing the end of the world.\n\nCOP\nChrist.  He's got five-inch heels.  The fuckin' runt wears\nelevator shoes!\n\nRORSCHACH\nNO!!  NO!!  GIVE IT BACK!!\n\nHe kicks and claws at the COPS as they drag him unceremoniously off\nto a nearby van.\n\nCOP II\nSo that's the terror of the underworld.  That ugly little zero.\n\nRORSCHACH\nGIVE ME BACK MY FACE!!!\n\nThe van doors slam shut on RORSCHACH -- just as the first FIRE TRUCKS\narrive to turn their hoses on the flaming skeleton of the tenement.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n137. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE stretched out on the sofa, under a blanket.  He\nstares up at the ceiling, still troubled.\n\nDREIBERG\nI'm sorry, Laurie.  I --\n\nLAURIE\nIt's all right, Dan.  I just want you to hold me, okay?  -- Just hold\nme.\n\nFor a few moments she lies nestled peacefully against his chest.  His\ngaze drifts over to the TV.  Suddenly he BLANCHES.\n\nLAURIE\nDaniel.  What --\n\nOn the TV screen is a huge bluescreen closeup of RORSCHACH.  DANIEL\nreaches for the remote control to turn up the volume.\n\nTV ANCHOR\n. . . A ten-year manhunt ended tonight with the capture of the masked\nvigilante known as Rorschach.  Eight CTU men died in the violent\nconfrontation at a downtown tenement . . .\n\nThe news report CUTS LIVE to the smoking wreckage of the tenement.\n\nLAURIE\nEight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.\n\nDREIBERG\nAre you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get\nto trial.\n\nNow the screen shows side-by-side closeups of the inkblot mask and\nthe acne-scarred face beneath it.  LAURIE looks on, transfixed.\n\nTV ANCHOR\n. . . identified as Walter Joseph Kovacs, 44, a transient with a\nhistory of psychological disorders.  A former landlord described\nKovacs as a self-confessed loner and political extremist:\n\nLANDLORD (ON TV)\nAll kinda weirdo literature, paraphernalia . . . you shoulda seen that\nplace when I threw him out.  Talk about pigpens --\n\nLAURIE hits the mute button, settles back and lets out a low\nwhistle.  DREIBERG, distracted, pours a glass of wine and gets up to\npace the room.\n\nLAURIE\nI just realized.  I'd never seen his face.\n(beat)\nI guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel?\nWhat's wrong?\n\nDREIBERG\nThe Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.\n\nHe stares at her, obviously wondering: who's next?\n\n138. EXT. NEWS KIOSK - EVENING\nThe familiar NEWS VENDOR peddling papers.  A feisty little BLACK KID\n-- the same one who made a face at RORSCHACH -- sits on the pavement\nnearby, reading a comic book.\n\nThe NEWS VENDOR nudges him, indicates the comic book: a patriotic\nlittle number entitled \"COLONEL NORTH AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS.\"\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nHey, this ain't a lending library.  I expect you to pay me for\nthat.\n\nKID\nNo way.  This one sucks.\n\nA CUSTOMER -- 50, black, on the tubby side -- stops at the\nnewsstand.  His name is DR. MALCOLM LONG.\n\nDR. LONG\nGazette, please.\n\nThe NEWS VENDOR hands over a copy of the Gazette.  The cover\nbears side-by-side photos of RORSCHACH and his alter ego, KOVACS,\nwith the banner headline: \"CTU APPREHENDS MASKED KILLER.\"\n\nNEWS VENDOR\n'Dyou see this?  This guy's a customer of mine!\n(shaking his head)\nI mean, I always knew he was a little flaky, but -- wild, huh?  You\nnever know.\n\nLONG hands over a quarter, unfolds the paper and begins to read as he\nwanders off down the street.\n\n139. STUDY - NIGHT\nDR. LONG, who happens to be a police psychiatrist, sits at a big desk\nwith a vast heap of paperwork -- which includes a mug sheet of\nRORSCHACH (minus the mask) and a neatly-typed arrest report from the\nNYPD:\n\nNAME: Kovacs, Walter Joseph\nADDRESS: Transient\nBORN: 3/21/43\nMOTHER'S NAME: Kovacs, Sylvia J. (nee Glick)\nFATHER'S NAME: Unknown\n\nBy now LONG is working on his third pot of coffee.  His wife, SYLVIA,\nwanders in behind him, dressed for bed in her robe and slippers.  When\nshe rests her hands on his shoulders, he nearly jumps out of his\nseat.\n\nDR. LONG\nOh!  Sorry.  I didn't hear you.\n\nSYLVIA\nHow much longer?\n(staring down at the desk)\nIt's that vigilante, isn't it.  That --\n\nDR. LONG\nRorschach\n(correcting himself)\nKovacs.  Incredible case.  Blinded two children at the age of ten.\nWe pulled his record from the juvenile home --\n\nWithout looking up he shoves a sheaf of papers in SYLVIA's\ndirection.\n\nDR. LONG (cont.)\nNo father.  Mother a prostitute.  Some evidence of systematic child\nabuse . . .\n(swiveling to face her)\nClassic case of misplaced aggression.  You know, these vigilantes,\nthese \"Watchmen\" -- there's never been a systematic study to find out\njust what makes them do it.\n\nSYLVIA\nMalcolm, don't get too -- overwhelmed by all this.\n\nSYLVIA picks up a blurry xerox of a child's drawing: TWO HIDEOUS\nFIGURES, male and female, with wild eyes, fangs, and matted hair.\nThey're conjoined like Siamese twins at the mouth, belly, and\ncrotch.  This twisted vision of coitus bears the crayoned title \"MY\nDREAM by W.J. Kovacs, Age 13.\"\n\nIt's too strong to look at for long.  She sets it down with a\nshiver.\n\nSYLVIA (cont.)\nWhy don't you come to bed?\n\nDR. LONG\n(totally engrossed)\nI'd like to get my hands on some of the others.  Explosive\nmaterial.\n(grabbing a transcript)\n\nMother died when he was fourteen.  When they told him, he had one\nword of comment: \"Good.\"\n\nSYLVIA shoots him a hard look, shakes her head almost imperceptibly,\nand gives up.  She turns and pads silently out of the room.  LONG\ngoes right on talking, unaware that his audience has left.\n\nDR. LONG (cont.)\nStill, he's not stupid.  In some ways he's got an\nextraordinary mind.  I think I can reach him.\n(nodding his head)\nI can reach him.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n140. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nA bare, windowless chamber, 10' by 10'.  LONG and RORSCHACH sit in\nfolding chairs on opposite sides of a square table.  The doctor\nreaches into his briefcase and pulls out a stack of CARDS.\n\nDR. LONG\nNow, Walter, you obviously know what these are.  I want you to look\nat each card in turn and tell me what it reminds you of.  All\nright?\n\nRORSCHACH's face is bruised, bloodied, and blank.  DR. LONG turns up\nthe first card, a symmetrical inkblot, part of a Rorschach test.\n\nRORSCHACH\nButterfly.\n\nLONG nods, makes a notation on a pad, turns up the next card.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nSome nice flowers.\n\nLONG eyes him skeptically, makes another note, turns up the third\ncard.  RORSCHACH stares at it for a long moment.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nA doggy.  A big old floppy-eared dog.\n\nHe shows the hint of a smile.  DR. LONG heaves a sigh of\nfrustration.\n\nDR. LONG\nWalter --\n\nRORSCHACH\nDon't call me that.\n\nDR. LONG\nWalter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to\nhear.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWrong answers?\n\nDR. LONG\nThere's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest\nresponse, I can't help you.\n(pause)\nI want to help you.  I want to know all about you.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.\n\nLONG knows the standard procedure for intransigent cases like this.\nHe shrugs indifferently, reaches for his briefcase, then gropes under\nthe table and presses a buzzer to summon the guards.\n\nDR. LONG\nWell, then.  Have it your way, Walter.  Let me know when you decide\nto cooperate.\n\nTWO PRISON GUARDS enter through a steel door.  RORSCHACH gets up to\nleave.  He pauses in the doorway.\n\nRORSCHACH\nDoctor.  You don't want to help me.  You just want to find out what\nmakes me sick.\n(beat)\nYou'll find out.  -- You'll find out.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n141. INT. VEIDT INDUSTRIES PYRAMID - DAY\nA huge open atrium on the ground floor, with marble columns,\nfountains, eucalyptus trees -- an Egyptian pleasure garden.\nJUSTINE's hanging out with her video crew; they spot VEIDT on the\ncentral escalator and swing into action.\n\nJUSTINE\nAdrian!  Adrian!  Can you give us a comment of Rorschach?\n\nHe's not at all happy to see her.  His FLUNKIES -- bodyguards and\nsecretaries -- form a wedge around him as he tries to push past the\ncameras.\n\nVEIDT\nNo comment.\n\nJUSTINE\nDid you know he was back on the streets?\n\nVEIDT\nI did not.  Now get out of my way!\n\nJUSTINE\nIsn't it true that you --\n\nHe keeps walking, with JUSTINE in hot pursuit.  Then, wide-eyed, he\nSTOPS IN HIS TRACKS.  An ARMED GUNMAN has stepped out from behind a\npillar -- directly into VEIDT's path.\n\nASSASSIN\nVEIDT!\n\nVEIDT DIVES.  The ASSASSIN'S BULLET catches JUSTINE in the gut and\ncomes out the other side in a spray of blood.  With a gymnast's\nagility VEIDT rolls to the right -- and comes up with a BRASS ASHTRAY\nin his hands.\n\nHe swings it into the ASSASSIN'S RIBS, knocking him backward into a\nFOUNTAIN.  The GUN skitters off across the marble floor.\n\nAs the SECURITY STAFF races up, VEIDT steps INTO THE FOUNTAIN and\nslams the dazed ASSASSIN'S HEAD into a decorative bust of King\nTut.\n\nVEIDT\nSon of a bitch.  Who sent you?\n\nArms flying, the two men grapple.  VEIDT grabs hold of a ASSASSIN's\nhair and thrusts a HAND into his MOUTH.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nStand back, Mr. Veidt!  We'll handle it!\n\nVEIDT\nHe's got some kind of poison capsule.  Don't bite down, you\nscum, I want to know who sent you!\n\nThe ASSASSIN gags -- and GOES LIMP.  His lifeless body slumps down\ninto the water.  VEIDT steps out, shaken and breathless.\n\nVEIDT\nGoddammit . . .\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nWho'd wanna kill you, Mr. Veidt?\n\nVEIDT\nI don't know.  I don't know.  -- Get an ambulance for Miss James.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n142. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - DUSK\nTIGHT ON a portable TV tuned to the evening news.\n\nNEWSCASTER\n-- third day of rioting in major European capitals amid escalating\nfears of nuclear war.  In London, six people were trampled outside\nSt. Paul's cathedral when overflow crowds were turned away from\nmorning Mass --\n\nA PHONE RINGS.  DREIBERG, who's sprawled on his bed watching the TV,\nreaches for the receiver.\n\nDREIBERG\nYeah.\n(beat)\nAdrian!  What's up?\n\n143. INTERCUT VEIDT AND DREIBERG\nVEIDT\nIn have something to tell you.  I wanted to call before you heard it\non the news.\n(beat)\nSomeone tried to kill me today.\n\nFor a moment DREIBERG says nothing.  He's not altogether\nsurprised.\n\nDREIBERG\nWho?\n\nVEIDT\nI don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm\nstarting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?\n\nDREIBERG\nShe's with me.\n\nVEIDT\nGood.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.\n(beat)\nLook, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until\nall this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.\n\nDREIBERG\nThanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.\n\nHe hangs up and weighs his options while he stares at the box.\nLAURIE enters from the hallway, dressed in a bathrobe, toweling off\nher hair.\n\nLAURIE\nOhh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?\n\nDREIBERG\nOne more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.\n(beat)\n. . . First time I've ever heard him scared.\n\nHe doesn't say any more than that.  He doesn't have to.  LAURIE picks\nup on the implications immediately.  She exhales sharply, turns away\nfrom him and steadies herself against a bureau.\n\nDREIBERG\n-- What is it.\n\nLAURIE\nI know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't\naround.\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie --\n\nLAURIE\nI'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --\n\nDREIBERG\nWith any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.\n\nHis sour wisecrack starts her trembling -- almost crying.  DREIBERG,\nfed up with his own pessimism, climbs out of bed and walks over\nbehind her.\n\nLAURIE\nI shouldn't be here anyway, Daniel.  There's something I haven't told\nyou --\n\nBut before she does he shushes her, wraps his arms around her from\nbehind.\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie, I'm not afraid.  I want you with me.  I want it more than\nanything else in the world.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n144. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT\nCONVICTS lined up with metal trays at a long cafeteria-style serving\narea.  RORSCHACH enters in prison greys.  As he makes his way toward\nthe dinner line, we PICK UP a chorus of comments from the nearby\ntables:\n\nVOICE\nHey Rorschach.  You dead, man.  Just a matter of time now --\n\nVOICE II\nRorschach.  Better put some meat on that pretty ass of yours --\n\nLow, threatening CHUCKLES all around as an expressionless RORSCHACH\npicks up his tray.  A TRIO OF GOONS falls in behind him.  The\nsmallest of them outweighs him by a good forty pounds.\n\nGOON I\nDidn't know he was such a tiny little thing.\n\nGOON II\nLittle?  Naw, he's a big man.  Big man.\n\nRORSCHACH'S FACE shows no emotion.  He moves forward in the line.  A\nSERVER drops a gristly chunk of meat on his tin plate.\n\nGOON III\nI'd like to get his autograph.  I got my autograph book right here. .\n.\n\nGOON III reaches into his pocket and withdraws an ICEPICK.\n\nGOON III (cont.)\nNotched up some big names over the years.\n\nSuddenly RORSCHACH spins, catching GOON III's head with the edge of\nhis dinner tray.  The icepick clatters to the floor.  GOON III\nfollows.\n\nThe others are on him in an instant, PINNING HIM against the serving\ncounter.  Instead of resisting, RORSCHACH vaults backward.  He brings\na KNEE up into GOON II's chine, grabs a fistful of GOON I's hair, and\ntumbles back OVER THE COUNTER -- dragging GOON I's head, face down,\ninto a steam tray full of bubbling SOUP.\n\nLanding on his feet, keeping his grip on GOON I's hair, RORSCHACH\nuses his free hand to bury a FORK in a CAFETERIA WORKER's gut.  GOON\nII lunges at him across the counter.  He grabs a VAT off a nearby\nburner and, with a single sweep of the arm, DOUSES both GOONS -- with\nHOT COOKING FAT.\n\nAll this has taken five seconds maximum.  WHISTLES shriek as the two\ndisfigured GOONS writhe on the floor in hideous agony, faces cracked\nand smoking.  CAFETERIA WORKERS clear a path as PRISON GUARDS rush in\nwith billy clubs drawn.\n\nAs the GUARDS haul him off, RORSCHACH emits a ferocious HISS.  It\nsounds uncannily like the sizzle of boiling oil on human flesh.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n145. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - NIGHT\nA prison TRUSTY wheels a cart down a long, empty corridor --\ndelivering dinner to the prisoners in solitary confinement.  Some of\nthe cells are visible, through ordinary barred entries; others are\ntotally sealed off, with sliding service trays mounted in solid metal\ndoors.\n\nAt a cell of the latter kind, the TRUSTY knocks once on the door,\nthen throws back a small panel to reveal the impassive face of\nRORSCHACH.\n\nTRUSTY\nHey Rorschach.  Those cats you threw the grease on -- they're dyin'\nman.\n(beat)\nTheir friends are talkin' 'bout it.  Say if those two go under . . .\nthis whole place blows.\n\nRORSCHACH emits his trademark HISS and turns from the door.  The\nTRUSTY chuckles in anticipation.\n\nTRUSTY (cont.)\nI'd hate to be you, man.  Locked in here with the likes of --\n\nRORSCHACH\nI'm not locked in here with them.  They're locked in here with me.\n\nWith that, the panel slides suddenly SHUT in the TRUSTY's face.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n146. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nLONG and RORSCHACH have changed rooms.  The new room -- two chairs, a\nsquare table -- is identical to the first, except for the REINFORCED\nWIRE MESH which spans its width, separating doctor from patient.\n\nThrough a narrow opening in the wire, DR. LONG slides a card across\nthe table for RORSCHACH's inspection.  It's the same series of\ninkblots as before, the \"butterfly\" leading off.  But this time, the\nsubject has decided to cooperate:\n\nRORSCHACH\nA whore fucking.\n\nDR. LONG\nWho is she?  Do you know her?\n\nToo obvious; no response.  LONG moves on to card #2 -- the \"nice\nflowers\":\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nMan's guts.  Falling out of his shirt.\n\nLONG clears his throat almost imperceptibly and nods.  Card #3:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nDoggy.  Big old floppy-eared dog --\n(pause; then, smiling)\n-- with his skull split open.\n\nDR. LONG\nAnd what -- split -- the dog's skull open?\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhy, doctor.  I did.\n(beat)\nHe was a bad dog.\n\nRORSCHACH is toying with him now.  DR. LONG gets down to brass\ntacks.\n\nDR. LONG\nWalter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In\nyour mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?\n\nRORSCHACH\nGod isn't there to do it.\n\nDR. LONG\nWe don't know that.\n\nRORSCHACH eyes him for a moment, then nods sagely: oh yes we do.\n\nDR. LONG\nSo the rest of the world is wrong, and you're right.  Is that it?\n(no response)\nYou tried to help people once.  What turned you around?  -- Why\nwould you want to kill a dog?\n\nWith LONG firmly on the hook, RORSCHACH settles back to elucidate:\n\nRORSCHACH\nOne night I opened my eyes -- saw the world.\n\n147. EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\nRuined buildings, broken windows.  The streets are silent except for\nthe distant sound of dogs BARKING.  RORSCHACH'S NARRATION continues\nOVER SCENE:\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O.)\n'75.  Kidnap case, the little Franco girl.  Weeks dragged by -- no\nword.  Thought of little child, alone, frightened . . . decided to\nintervene.\n\nThe lone figure of RORSCHACH emerges from the shadows and turns up\nhis collar.  He strides deliberately down the sidewalk past a\nramshackle wooden storm fence covered with obscene graffiti.\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)\nGot a tip.  Abandoned dress factory in Brooklyn.\n\nHe peers through a broken slat in the fence.  In a side yard, TWO\nHUGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS growl playfully, fighting over some unseen\nobject.\n\n148. INT. DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\nA DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file,\nflicks on a flashlight.\n\nMannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The\nlight shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders\nover.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and\non the floor, a ROPE.\n\nThere's a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it,\nsticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a\ncharred scrap of FABRIC from a child's pajamas, decorated with\nballoons and teddy bears.\n\nHe stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden\nCHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding\nparaphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher's\nknives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh\nWINDOW.\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)\nDogs wouldn't shut up.  That's when I knew where the little girl had\ngone.\n\n149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\nThe German shepherds romp in the dying light.

He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his\nreply, asks:\n\nDR. LONG\nThen what happened?\n\nRORSCHACH\n. . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had\nto break in.\n\n152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)\nThe FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He's\nhandcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a\nGROCERY SACK.\n\nHe kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off\nhis glove and reaches into the sack.\n\nFAT MAN\nWhat -- what are you d--\n\nRORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER\ninto his open mouth.  He's got several pounds of the stuff, and he\nspends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN's face,\nthroat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he's\ndone, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER\nBLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN's head.\n\nFRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door,\nand -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs\ninside.\n\nThen he stands back and enjoys the carnage.\n\n153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nDR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things\nup.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhen they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their\nskulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies.\n(leaning forward)\nSee, God didn't kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed\nher . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did,\nhe did't seem to mind.\n\nDR. LONG\nThat man, then, he was the first.  The first you --\n\nRORSCHACH\nSaw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make\nit that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.\n(slight smile)\nWhat else can I illuminate?\n\nLONG's had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the\nPRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he\npoints a finger at LONG's inkblot.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nNo right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . .\njust a man's face.\n(pause)\nSee it now?\n\nThe GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a\ncouple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a\nsecond he reaches for his briefcase; as he's gathering his cards, he\nSTOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern\non top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.\n\nLONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the\nRorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n154. EXT.

A COMPACT BUBBLE-CAR pulls\nup outside a big ramshackle barn and stops; DREIBERG gets out, goes to\nthe padlocked doors, fumbles in his pocket for a key.\n\nAfter a moment, LAURIE wanders up beside him.\n\nLAURIE\nEnough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?\n\nDREIBERG\nMemory lane.\n\nHe opens the padlock, ushers LAURIE inside.\n\n155. INT. BARN - A MOMENT LATER\nInside the barn is a HUGE OBLONG SHAPE covered with a TARPAULIN.\n\nLAURIE\nDaniel . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nGimme a hand with the tarp, would you?  You take that side.\n\nShe goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull\nit back to reveal . . .\n\nTHE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL's high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It's a bit\ntarnished from years of disuse, but it's still an impressive sight.\nDREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around\nto join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.\n\nLAURIE\nThe Owlship.  I can't believe it.\n\nDREIBERG\n-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.\n\n156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on\nthe electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin,\nreliving days gone by.\n\nLAURIE\nWow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?\n\nDREIBERG\nI took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some\ncows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.\n\nLAURIE\nAntarctica??\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come\nalong.\n(pause)\nI've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a\nbad place to sit out a war.\n\nLAURIE\nWould you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be\nleft.\n\nDREIBERG\nYou and me.\n\nHe looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her\ngaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the\ncabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly\nrejected.\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . Yeah, you're right.  Probably wouldn't make it down there\nanyway.\n\nBehind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She's just\nopened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES\n-- their old superhero togs.\n\nLAURIE\nDan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.\n\nDREIBERG\nMe neither.  Mine barely even fits.\n(chuckling)\nThe thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping\npeople, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't\nknow.  It all seems so abstract.\n\nLAURIE's holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing\nherself in a small mirror above a sink.\n\nLAURIE\nGod, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat are you up to?\n\nLAURIE\nDon't look.  Turn around.\n\nSmirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the\ncabin.\n\nDREIBERG\nThis'd better not be what I think it is.\n\nLAURIE\nOkay!\n\nDREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE's in full costume, looking quite\nimposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns\nshock:\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nMy God, it's the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender\nof the weak!\n\nLAURIE\nIn the flesh.\n\nShe ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind,\nand strokes his thinning hair.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nPoor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don't you.\n\nDREIBERG\nSaving the world?  I guess I do.\n(smiling)\nMaybe we can still save ourselves . . .\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n157. EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - DUSK\nA massive PEACE RALLY downtown.  Thousands of citizens have turned\nout; PLACARDS and PROTEST SIGNS are everywhere.  Each remark is met\nby CHEERS and CHANTS, by raucous\nBOOS as well . . . and while the crowd is split between pacifists and\nhawks, they're all frightened as hell.\n\nThings are much the same in London, Berlin -- possibly even Moscow.\nThe end is nigh, and passions flare.  It's anarchy waiting to\nhappen.\n\nMAN ON STAGE\nYou know what the Joint Chiefs of Staff are doing right now?  They're\nsitting in the Pentagon talking about a first strike.  That's right --\na first strike!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD\nYou think the reds ain't doing the same thing?\n\nMAN ON STAGE\nThen for the love of God let's negotiate.  We can start a war.  But\nwe can't stop it!!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD II\nIt's pinko simps like you that drove Dr. Manhattan to Mars!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD III\nDr. Manhattan was an inhuman fascist!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD IV\nIt's God's judgment!  Jesus is the way!\n\nA HECKLER fights his way onstage and lunges for the microphone:\n\nHECKLER\nRussia's just been waiting for an opening.  They won't show us\nno mercy.  I say NUKE 'EM NOW!!\n\nMAN ON STAGE\nYou think this is some kind of grudge match??  We're talking the\nend of the world!!\n\nThe two of them grapple at the mike, and the HECKLER falls off the\nstage.  On cue, the crowd ERUPTS.  FIGHTS break out; COPS start\nswinging rifle butts.\n\nAs PRO-NUKERS swarm the stage, our gaze turns upward.  A trio of\nHOVERCRAFT hangs in the air above the seaport.  Their undersides --\noutfitted with heavy artillery on turrets -- bear the initials\n\"CTU\"\n\n158. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK\nCTU MEN watch the nascent riot through a plexiglass canopy.\n\nCTU CAPTAIN\nI've had it with these a-holes.  Drop the gas.\n\n159. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK\nPANIC amongs the crowds as TEAR GAS CANISTERS explode in their\nmidst.  The CTU ships descend ever closer to the ground.\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nCEASE AND DESIST AT ONCE.  WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO USE FORCE.\n\nA couple of COPS go down in the melee.  RIOTERS grab their rifles,\nturn them on the CTU ships overhead.  OTHERS in the crowd fling\nrocks, brickbats -- whatever's handy.  HYSTERIA RULES.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n160. INT. BARN - DUSK\nDREIBERG walks around to the front of the Owlship with a TOOLKIT,\nwiping his hands on an oily rag.  He calls inside to LAURIE:\n\nDREIBERG\nGuess that ought to do it.  Let's shut her down --  Laurie?\n\nNo reply.  Curious, he climbs aboard.\n\n161. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nLAURIE's standing by the monitor over the instrument console.  Her\nface is distraught, agonized.\n\nLAURIE\nDaniel, you ought to take a look at this.\n\nOnscreen, it's total screaming chaos.  CANNONS on the bellies of the\nCTU HOVERCRAFT swivel randomly, spitting AUTOMATIC FIRE at the mobs\nbelow.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat the hell -- ?\n\nLAURIE\nIt's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.\n\nDREIBERG\nOh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.\n\nHe turns away, paralyzed with horror.  LAURIE watches awestruck.\n\nLAURIE\nThey're just mowing 'em down.\n(pause)\nThis is it.  The end of the world.  This is what it looks like.\n\nCAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on DREIBERG's stricken face as we\n\nCUT TO:\n\n162. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE>\nWe're back in slo-mo sepia land, the Golden Age of Superheroes.  THE\nOWLSHIP emerges from a fogbank and rises majestically into frame,\nlike the Seventh Cavalry arriving to save the day.  As it draws\ncloser, the perspex canopy coming into view, we can just make out\nNIGHT OWL at the helm, with SILK SPECTRE riding shotgun.\n\nThere's a FRENZIED MOB below, racing right and left, their aimless\nmotions stylized and surreal.  They're beset by a sudden WINDSTORM as\nthe Owlship's powerful BLOWERS clear the TEAR GAS from this fantasy\nequivalent of the seaport plaza.  Faces turn skyward; fingers point --\n\n-- and suddenly, the footage we're watching undergoes a SUBTLE\nTRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the\naction QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we're in\nfull-color and real-time --\n\n163. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\n-- because the Owlship is really there . . . and by God, the\nWatchmen are back in action a quarter-mile above the South St.\nSeaport!\n\n164. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe three CTU SHIPS are now visible through the cockpit dome.\n\nDREIBERG\nOkay Laurie, let's see if we've still got what it takes.\n\nOn the panel, a COMPUTER TARGETING DEVICE homes in on a CTU SHIP.\n\n165. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT\nA RADAR MAN stares at his console in puzzlement.\n\nCTU RADAR MAN\nSir, we've got an odd blip off starboard . . .\n\nThe ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY as a sudden EXPLOSION --\n\n166. AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT\n-- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured\nship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets\nsputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against\nthe water.\n\n167. ANGLE ON CROWD\npointing at the skies in disbelief.\n\nVOICE IN CROWD\nLOOK!  UP THERE!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD II\nOh my God, it's --\n\n\n168. INT. OWLSHIP - ON DREIBERG\nHe barks into a microphone:\n\nDREIBERG\nAttention CTU!  Cease fire immediately --\n\n169. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK\nGround level.  From the midst of the bewildered CROWD we watch as the\nOWLSHIP and the CTU talk some serious trash:\n\nOWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER\n-- or we'll BLOW YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE SKY!\n\nCTU LOUDSPEAKER\nUNREGISTERED CRAFT.  IDENTIFY YOURSELF.\n\nOWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER\nBABY . . . WE'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.\n\nThe crowd's in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But\na dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the\nstrange sight overhead.\n\nVOICE IN CROWD\n. . . IT'S THE WATCHMEN!!\n\nEXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air,\nclumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging\nimmobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West\nshowdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate\ninto position.\n\n170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.\n\nDREIBERG\nWe're gonna have to shave this one close.\n\nAn instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle\nFULL-FORWARD.\n\n171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\nWith a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS\nCONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond\nbefore -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES\nFORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD\nCHEERS.\n\n172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nDREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the\naft view from the ship.\n\nLAURIE\nThey're following us.\n\nDREIBERG\nAll right.  Mission accomplished.\n\nHe's no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the\nship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.\n\n173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU\nSHIPS rip past on either side.\n\n174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT\nASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The\nOWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE\nblows a HOLE in its facade.\n\n175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\nfiring TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.\n\n176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar\nreadout:\n\nLAURIE\nMissed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.\n\nLAURIE\n(checking the monitor)\nThey're practically on us . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nThat Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.\n\nHe punches a button on the dash.  It's labelled \"TURBO.\"\n\n177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP\nThe turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving\nthe CTU craft in the dust.\n\n178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT\nA line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly,\nand -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.\n\nA moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The\nless-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and\nEXPLODES\n\nThe SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last\nmoment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP\nITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles\nfor the airborne route.\n\n179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER\nThe OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the\ncars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.\n\nThere's an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges\nUP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS\nagainst the roof of the tunnel.\n\n180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe end of the tunnel is coming up fast.\n\nDREIBERG\nFog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.\n\n181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an\nalmost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its\nwake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives --\nbut, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward\non a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the\nwater.\n\n182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nThey're in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of\nintense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.\n\nLAURIE\nWe lost him.\n\nHe flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she\nshakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nOh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.\n\nFADE THROUGH TO:\n\n183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT\nThe usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving\nline.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall\nand falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of\nhim.\n\nTRUSTY\nJust left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.\n\nThe CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes\nthrough the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds,\nit's reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named\nT-BONE.\n\nCON IN LINE\nOtis went down.\n\nT-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of\nSIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the\nbiggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET:\nLITTLE BIGGER.\n\nT-BONE\nJust heard, boss.  Otis bought it.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nFuckin' Rorschach.\n(nodding to himself)\nThis joint goes up.  Tonight.\n\n184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nDrifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship\nemerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale\nblue moonlight.\n\n185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nThrough the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then\ndisappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We're taking a dreamy tour\nof the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is\nsinging \"You're My Thrill.\"\n\nInstruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one's at the\ncontrols.\n\nThe ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the\nwidth of the cabin floor.  A woman's hand reaches for it, sets it\nright.\n\nIt's LAURIE, who's midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG.\nThe pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the\ncabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.\n\nLAURIE\nBetter.  Much better.\n\nDREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile\ninstead.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nI bet I know what made the difference this time.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat?\n\nLAURIE\n(smirking)\nThe costumes.  Am I right?\n\nDREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite\nhimself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nCome on.  Admit it!\n\nDREIBERG\nNo way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.\n\nLAURIE\nYes you are.\n\nDREIBERG\n(drily)\nNo offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.\n(pause; then, seriously)\nTonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's because --\n\nDREIBERG\nIt's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's\nabout to end.\n(a weird smile)\nI feel like I could save it.\n\nHe grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to\nthe instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship\nhard right.\n\nLAURIE\nYou're full of yourself.  What are you doing?\n\nDREIBERG\nLong as we're on the subject of perverts . . .\n(turning to face her)\nI miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.\n\nLAURIE\n. . . What??\n\nDREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches\nfor the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.\n\n186. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT\nAFTERBURNERS belch flame as the Owlship accelerates, ripping through\nthe clouds above the city.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n187. SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PRISON\n-- and as Sly Stone once said, there's a riot goin' on.  SIRENS HOWL\nas we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild:\ndisabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons,\nthrowing food.\n\n188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG's eyes are\nriveted to a monitor over the controls:\n\nDREIBERG\nI think we're just a trifle late.\n\nLAURIE\nJesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .\n\nThe MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below\nthem.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire\nwith the guards in the watchtower.  It's an ugly, bloody mess.\n\nDREIBERG\nI know he's totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen\ntimes.\n\n189. INT. CELL - NIGHT\nSIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs\ndrawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.\n\n190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT\nSmoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past\nsprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR\nMENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It's the\npsychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE,\nand T-BONE.\n\nWheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop\noutside RORSCHACH's cell and GRIN in anticipation.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nFind an outlet for this thing\n(shouting)\nRorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It's payback time!\n\nRAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying\na big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH's\ndoor, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.\n\nCARLOS\nSee this, runt?  We're gonna take your puny little balls off . . .\nand pickle 'em!!\n(chortling)\nAww!  I think he just wet his pants!\n\nHILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place\nat the panel in the door:\n\nT-BONE\nLemme see.  Lemme see!\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nRelax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve.\n(to T-BONE)\nWhat's he doin' now?\n\nNo response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed\ntightly to the panel.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER (cont.)\nYou deaf?  I said, what's he --\n\nHe gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE's legs buckle and he topples over\nbackwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON\nquivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye\nsocket.\n\nRAFE\nBOSS!  JESUS!\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nSon of a bitch! -- WE'RE COMING RORSCHACH.  WE'RE GONNA PEEL YOU LIKE\nA GRAPE.\n(to RAFE)\nLight the torch.\n\nRAFE ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of\nRORSCHACH's cage.\n\n191. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT\nRORSCHACH waiting patiently on his bunk.  The metal lock on the\ninside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n192. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG hands LAURIE what looks like a pair of electronic\nEARMUFFS.\n\nDREIBERG\nOkay, I'm turning on the screamers.  We'll have to hit the roof\nrunning . . .\n\nHe throws a switch on the control panel.\n\n193. EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nWINDOWS SHATTER in the guard towers as a WAILING ULTRASONIC SCREECH\nsplits the air.  On the roof of the complex, PARALYZED GUARDS drop\ntheir weapons; ESCAPED PRISONERS clutch at their burst eardrums as\nthe Owlship descends and gently touches down. . .\n\n194. INT. RORSCHACH'S CELL - THAT MOMENT\nThe LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH'S\nFACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the\nwall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his\nTOILET.\n\nGrunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its\nmounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is\nFLOODED.\n\n195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER\nRAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.\n\nRAFE\nOkay, boss, that oughta do it.\n\nThey give the door a shove.  It swings inward, and GALLONS OF WATER\ncome gushing out.  LITTLE BIGGER steps back in disgust.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nWHAT THE --\n\nRAFE and CARLOS gape into the cell.  They see the broken toilet, but\nthere's no trace of RORSCHACH.\n\nCARLOS\nRorschach.  Company's calling . . .\n\nRAFE\nWhere is the fuckin' runt?\n\nCARLOS advances cautiously toward the cell, the CLEAVER in his\nfist.\n\n196. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT\nIn answer to RAFE's question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door.\nHe SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO's outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of\nthe LOCK catches CARLO'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .\n\n. . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS,\nmonkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide\nand an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.\n\nCARLOS\nYOU'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --\n\nFrom the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor\nBETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --\n\n-- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --\n\n-- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do\na herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --\n\n-- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock\nDIM and DIE.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down\noff his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies\nof the dead.\n\nRORSCHACH\nYour move . . . runt.\n\nThe midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor\nas fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.\n\n197. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER\nDREIBERG and LAURIE move down a dark, abandoned corridor, trying to\nget their bearings.\n\nLAURIE\nWhere are we?  What happened to the lights?\n\nDREIBERG\nGenerators'll kick on in a minute.  We should be close to solitary .\n. .\n\nTheir heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND\nCORRIDOR crosses the one they're standing in.  As they watch, a\nSCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.\n\nDREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a\nfamiliar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . Rorschach??\n\nRORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second\nand a half -- then keeps on walking.\n\n198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER\nThe terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he's just hit a dead end.  He\nthrows a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him.\nDesperate, he ducks into a MEN'S ROOM.\n\nRORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him,\nLAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross\ncorridor.\n\nLAURIE\nRorschach!  Is that you??\n\nHe turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and\ndispassionate, he enters the MEN's room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand\nat the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat's he doing?\n\nDREIBERG\nI think he's going to the john.\n\nLAURIE\nMy God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and\nhe stops to take a --\n\nBefore she can finish, RORSCHACH reemerges, wiping his hands on a\npaper towel.  He wanders up to join them without so much as a\n\"howdy.\"\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . That was quick.\n\nRORSCHACH\nToilet clogged.  Short fat turd.\n(beat)\nLet's get out of here.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n199. EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT\nA well-concealed RUNWAY somewhere in the heart of the Rocky\nMountains.  LIGHTS sweep the sky as GROUND CREWS run to and fro.\n\nAir Force One is coming in for a landing.\n\n200. INT. UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER\nLots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling\nabout.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and\nwhat looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal\nramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON's in the passenger seat, and there's an\nimposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating\na long stay.\n\nPRESIDENT NIXON\nHello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY\nShe's all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right\naway.\n\nLIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless\ncorridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY (cont.)\nWeatherman says we're lookin' good.  We've got a fourteen-hour\nwindow.\n\nPRESIDENT NIXON\nFourteen hours, huh?\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY\nFourteen hours.  Unless of course the reds decide to hit us first.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n201. INT.

Earlier eyewitness reports place\nthe one-time superheroes at a peace rally in --\n\n. . . while DREIBERG and RORSCHACH sit side-by-side at the control\nconsole, occupied by other matters.\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his\nmangy cat on me.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat new information?\n\nRORSCHACH\nBlake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan\nsomehow involved . . .\n(scratching his chin)\n\nStrange that no one's tried to attack you, Daniel.\n\nThere's an unmistakable tone of suspicion in his voice.  DREIBERG,\nhighly offended, shoots him a look of supreme resentment.\n\nDREIBERG\nI beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.\n\nLAURIE\nWill you two lovebirds keep it down?\n\nStill grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at\nthe monitor LAURIE's watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the\nscreen:\n\nNEWSCASTER\n. . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was\nunavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the\nAntarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.\n\nRORSCHACH\n\"Ozone layer\"?\n\nDREIBERG\n(rolling his eyes)\nChrist.  Couldn't he just admit that he's scared??\n\nCUT TO:\n\n202. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT\nThe last rays of sunlight bleed toward endless frozen plains of\npristine white.  A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous\nstrip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered\naround what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is\none.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT's Antarctic retreat.\n\n203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT\nThe entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian\nstyle as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad\nfigure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered\nLYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him.\nOne of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a\nsilver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back\nof the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.\n\nLACKEY\nWelcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.\n\nVEIDT\nFeed Bubastis.  I'll have dinner when I've looked in on the world.\n\nThey hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him\nto:\n\n204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT\nThe room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated\nREMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair,\nRED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.\n\nVEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal\na towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid,\npicking up transmissions from all over the world.  It's far more\ninformational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp,\na hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in\nand his eyes begin to rove.\n\n205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL\nPANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials,\nsitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled \"LONDON.\"\nVEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER'S VOICE\ncomes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense\nlogo . . .\n\nBBC NEWSCASTER\n-- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as\npossible.  Cinderblock walls are preferred, but a makeshift shelter\ncan be constructed of sandbags, or of boxes filled with --\n\nFLICK, and the sound dies.  VEIDT's gaze drifts several screens to\nthe right, to the monitor labelled \"WASHINGTON D.C.\"  Sound up:\n\nNEWSCASTER\n-- amid rumors that top-ranking officials and military personnel have\nalready been relocated to underground bunkers.  White House spokesmen\ninsist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing\nnegotiations --\n\nFLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the\nbottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT's antarctic\nretreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new\nangle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are\nclear.  FLICK --\n\n-- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we're\nwatching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from\ntwenty-some years ago; he's sitting at a table in the Gila Flas\ncanteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he's getting ready to\npropose.\n\n206.

AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT\nLOW ANGLE on the Owlship as it descends slowly through the clouds.\nOn its underbelly, a VIDEO CAMERA grinds and rotates.\n\n208. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of\nthe city.  He punches up a series of PROGRESSIVE MAGNIFICATIONS,\ngradually zeroing in on a single city block.  It's been cordoned off,\nPOLICE BUBBLE-CARS are parked up and down its length.\n\nDREIBERG\nThey've got my building surrounded.\n(looking up at her)\nThey must've been following you all along.\n\nShe stares at him.  The ship LURCHES as DREIBERG kicks in the\naccelerator jets and takes off into the clouds.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nSo much for Dan Dreiberg, ordinary citizen.\n\nLAURIE\nWelcome back, Night Owl.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?\n\nRORSCHACH\nCTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat do you mean, frame-up?\n\nRORSCHACH\nObvious pattern -- all ties in --\n\nDREIBERG\nAre you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to\nget back at us?\n(spreading his hands)\nWhat about all those poor shits with cancer?\n\nTIGHT ON LAURIE, who's listening to all this with mounting\ndistress.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHow do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive\npropaganda scheme . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nCome on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --\n\nLAURIE\n(interrupting him)\nIt's not.\n\nRORSCHACH\nNot what?\n\nLAURIE\nNot \"propaganda.\"\n(pause; then, blurting it out --)\nChrist, I'm one of them!  I've got it.\n\nDREIBERG swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at LAURIE, his face\nbone-white.  She stares at the floor, afraid to meet his eyes, her\ngrim secret revealed.  For an awkward moment neither of them can\nthink of anything to say.\n\nThen RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the \"case,\" breaks the\nsilence.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHnrrr -- changes everything.  Let's get moving.\n\n209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he\npries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily\nat a RAT which scampers out of the hole.  The OWLSHIP hovers\nabove.\n\n210. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG, disconsolate, holds LAURIE gently by the shoulders.\n\nLAURIE\nI should've told you, Dan.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted things between\nus to be -- happy.  For a while.  I --\n\nDREIBERG\nIt doesn't change a thing, Laurie.  I love you.\n\nHe tries to pull her close but she turns away, her eyes welling up\nwith tears.\n\nLAURIE\nI love you too, Dan, I -- why don't you give me a minute to get\nmyself together, okay?\n\n211. EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nA distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP.\nRORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of\nsatisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees\nDREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.\n\nAbove their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.\n\n212. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nLAURIE backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona\nresolves itself into the figure of DR. MANHATTAN.\n\nLAURIE\nJon.  What are you doing here?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.\n\nLAURIE\nCollect me?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nIn the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye.\nYou're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .\n\nLAURIE\nJon, no -- I can't --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nIt will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us\ncan do anything to change it.\n\nDREIBERG's frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside\nthe cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR.\nMANHATTAN's hand.\n\nDREIBERG\nLAURIE!  DON'T --\n\nHands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and\nLAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.\n\nStunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There's obviously nothing he can\ndo.  RORSCHACH is only a second or two behind them.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhere's Laurie?\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't think she's coming with us.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n213. EXT. MARS - NIGHT\nA BLUE SLIT opens in the sky, mere inches above the Martian\nsurface;  DR. MANHATTAN steps placidly through, and a moment later\nLAURIE tumbles out behind him.  She takes a couple of halting steps,\nthen GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red\nsands.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN's gone several paces before he realizes there's a\nproblem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at\nthe air, trying and failing to draw a breath.  He walks patiently back\nand extends his hand;  LAURIE grabs it, and is magically surrounded by\na HALO OF OXYGEN.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThe atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.\n\nLAURIE\nJesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --\n\nIgnoring her, he turns.  She hurries to keep pace with him.  Then she\nstops in her tracks.\n\nBefore her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN's new abode: a\nPALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren\nsands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS,\nsurrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and\npendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering\ncrystalline castle.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI live here now.\n\nHe strides placidly forward.  LAURIE, boggled, stumbles along after\nhim.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n214. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nTIGHT ON the distraught DREIBERG, his pained face illuminated by the\nglow of the instrument panel.  RORSCHACH sits calmly behind him.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHeading south.  What's the plan?\n\nDREIBERG\nWe're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're\nhightailing it down to Adrian's.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --\n\nDREIBERG\n(exploding)\nCases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to\nend.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't\nmatter.\n\nRORSCHACH\nCoward.  Giving up.\n\nDREIBERG\nSHUT UP, Rorschach.\n\nRORSCHACH settles back, lets out a soft, thoughtful HISS.\n\nRORSCHACH\nSorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.\n(pause)\nSorry about Laurie.\n\nDREIBERG\n(choked voice)\nOkay, let's just . . . thank you.\n\nFor a few moments they fly on in silence.  RORSCHACH can't leave well\nenough alone.  Deep in thought, he scratches his chin.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt's not stupid.  Could have angle.  -- Might be good move.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n215. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT\nLAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals\naround the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the\nenormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING\n-- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.\n\nLAURIE\nThis whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me\nyou're sleeping with Dreiberg.\n\nLAURIE\nYou -- you know about me and Dan?\n\nHe gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nTime is the key, Laurie.  If I can unlock the origins of time, I'll\nfinally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity.\n\nLAURIE looks at him crosseyed -- and heaves a sigh.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?\n(flustered)\nDan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks\nat me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of\natoms.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\n(startled)\nThen you're sleeping with Dreiberg?\n\nLAURIE\nWell, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThat's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even\nmy responses.\n(nodding)\nWe're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  --\nThirty seconds.\n\nShe GROANS in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle\nof the huge glass tower.  The Martian plains spread out for miles\nbelow them; above, the stars stretch to infinity.  A chill, violent\nWIND whips across their faces.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'll be here for the next year or so.  Then I'm going to work my way\nout toward the edge of the universe.\n(staring out at the landscape)\nUtterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn't it beautiful?\n\nShe moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and\nfissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and\nfrightened.\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me\nonce?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.\n\nLAURIE\nYet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be\nbeing with me.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't\nknow what did.\n\nLAURIE\nBut you knew that I'd -- die.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nMemories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to\ndwell on the unpleasant ones . . .\n(pause)\nYou won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.\n\nLAURIE's blood runs cold as she realizes what he's telling her.\n\nLAURIE\nThen it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've\nalways known.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\n(nodding)\nAlways.  Ever since the day I died.\n\nHe walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the\nforbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in\nher hands.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\nDo you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it's been like for me\nthese last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be\ndestroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless\nagent of its destruction?\n\nLAURIE\n(sobbing)\nThen why don't you . . . do something about it!\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nBecause --\n\nLAURIE\nBecause you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.\n(angrily)\nJon.  This, this \"script\" you're following . . . who writes it?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six\nhundred years.\n\nThat about tears it for LAURIE.  She storms over and grabs him by the\nshoulders:\n\nLAURIE\nI can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to\ndie I want to be with -- other people.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nPlease, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a\nuniverse to explore.  I'll be alone.\n(reaching for her hand)\nYou're the last human being I'll ever see.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n216. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP streaking through the icy stratosphere above the south\nAtlantic.  Suddenly it BOUNCES in midair -- JERKS to the right -- and\nbegins to SPIRAL DOWNWARD into the clouds . . .\n\n217. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG is frantically throwing switches as they lurch to and fro.\nFinally he manages to get the ship righted.  RORSCHACH's taken a bad\ntumble; he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks:\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhat happened?\n\nDREIBERG\nThe guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some\nkind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhat caused it?\n\nDREIBERG\nDon't know.  Nothing I can think of --\n(apprehensively)\n-- outside of a nuclear blast.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n218. EXT. ANTARCTICA - KARNAK - NIGHT\nVEIDT'S VAST COMPLEX is little more than a DIM GLOW, barely visible\nthrough a SWIRLING BLIZZARD.\n\n219. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nVEIDT sits before his VIDEO WALL, sipping mulled wine from a goblet.  Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled ³MOSCOW² and ³WASHINGTON, D.C.² -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.\n\nA second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.  VEIDT leans back in his chair and cocks an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed.\n\n220. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP streaks downward through a TOTAL WHITEOUT.\n\n221. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThrough the cockpit, KARNAK¹s visible -- for an instant.  Then, it¹s lost in the snows again.\n\nDREIBERG\nI¹m taking her down.\n(frantically throwing switches)\nRadar¹s blown.  I¹ll have to wing it.  Strap in, Rorschach --\n\nThe SHIP ROCKS with the force of a premature IMPACT.\n\n222. EXT. ANTARCTICA - ON OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe OWLSHIP takes a HARD BOUNCE against the snow.  The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.\n\nA HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They¹re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.\n\n223. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nVEIDT¹s eyeing the closed-circuit SECURITY MONITOR which shows the exterior of the complex.  He spots TWO TINY FIGURES slogging through the blizzard.\n\nAs he watches, the screens for ³LONDON² and ³PARIS² go WHITE.\n\n224. EXT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER\nDREIBERG and RORSCHACH, half-frozen and covered in frost, make it to the great metal entry doors -- and START BANGING.  A VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the door rotates into position.  A soothing, computerized WOMAN¹S VOICE announces:\n\nVOICE\nWelcome to Karnak.  Please identify yourself.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian!  It¹s Dreiberg.  For God¹s sake open the doors.\n\nNothing happens.  DREIBERG POUNDS against the doors.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nAdrian!  We¹re freezing to death out here!\n\nHe slumps to the ground exhausted, barely able to draw a breath.  The snow lies in FOUR-FOOT DRIFTS against the door.\n\nRORSCHACH\n. . . He¹s not coming, Daniel.\n\n225. INT KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nOn the surveillance monitor, RORSCHACH and DREIBERG shamble off.  VEIDT stands, hits his remote.  The picture dies -- leaving a mere 199 screens in operation.\n\nThe wall is now checkerboarded with monitors showing nothing but VIDEO SNOW.  As VEIDT strides calmly out of the room, ³PRAGUE² goes white.\n\n226. EXT. KARNAK - NIGHT\nDREIBERG on his knees, half-buried in snow.  He topples forward, unable to go on.  A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enter frame and YANK HIM UPWARD.\n\nDREIBERG\nCan¹t move . . . we¹re done for.\n\nRORSCHACH\nCome on.  Found an exhaust vent.\n\nRORSCHACH drags the helpless DREIBERG around the side of the complex, where SNOW blows in flurries at the mouth of a TUNNEL-LIKE STRUCTURE.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nVeidt.  It¹s been Veidt all along.  He¹ll pay for this.\n\n227. INT. KARNAK - DINING HALL - NIGHT\nVEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall, coolly eating dinner.  Behind him, above the mammoth entry doors, hangs a TAPESTRY -- Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot.\n\nTWO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall.\n\nVEIDT sits calmly, betraying nothing.  At his side, the MUTANT LYNX\ngrowls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal's\nneck: quiet, girl.\n\nRORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN\nFLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening\nscene.  Suddenly . . .\n\nRORSCHACH\nVEIDT!\n\nVEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall;\nit catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG\nbacks against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward\nhim, TEETH BARED.\n\nVEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a\nfuturistic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along --\npart of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?\n\nRORSCHACH\nHe's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --\n\nVEIDT\nYeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of\ncourse . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nThe missing scientists.\n\nVEIDT\nUh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked\nat Gila Flats.\n\nRORSCHACH\nGila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .\n\nVEIDT\nDr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save\nthe world.\n\n228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nGun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak.\nRORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping\nat his heels.\n\nVEIDT\nBlake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers\n-- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn't Russia.\n(tapping his chest)\nIt was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill\nhim.  The rest of it -- Rorschach's capture, my \"assassination\" --\nthat was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting\nrid of Dr. Manhattan.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat??\n\nVEIDT\nI couldn't let him interfere with my project.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt.  You're the one who started World War III.\n\nVEIDT\nNo.  I just hastened the inevitable.\n(smiling)\nHe's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a\nlittle push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates\ncancer.\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie?  You're responsible for --\n\nVEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls\nout a smoke and strikes it against the box.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nOne thing I've learned about cancer -- it's much easier to generate\nthan it is to cure.\n\nDREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the\nstun gun across DREIBERG's face, knocking him to the floor -- and\nLEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.\n\nVEIDT\nLet's get something straight.  If you try that again, I'll kill you\nwithout a moment's thought.\n\nThey've reached the entrance to VEIDT's information room.  200\nSCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them\ninside.\n\nRORSCHACH\nCall off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.\n\nVEIDT\nBefore you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking\nat.\n\n229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nVEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand\ncorner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila\nFlats, reassembling a WATCH.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat is this?  It looks like Jon.\n\nVEIDT\nIt is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr.\nManhattan.\n\nDREIBERG\nGood Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?\n\nVEIDT\nIt's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him,\nLAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she's\nhit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On\nMars.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can't die.  It's a\nmystery I'd like to penetrate.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, I do not want to hear it.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .\n\nLAURIE\n(shaking her head)\nOh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYou're the only human being I care for.\n\nLAURIE\nThen do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter\na bit.\n(pause)\nI want you to cure me.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI won't do that.\n\nLAURIE\nYou have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.\n\nLAURIE\nJon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you\n-- then do it.\n\nEyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her\nchest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.\n\nHer fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR.\nMANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he's got to make the\nhardest decision of his life.  And then . . .\n\nA BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN\nINTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian\nlandscape altogether.\n\nWith a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see\nthe figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great\nwhite VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the\nMartian desert gradually materialize around them.\n\nThe two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like\nstatues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what's happened.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat -- am I --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nCured, yes.\n\nUtterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a\nhandrail for support.  He looks like a man who's just had a heart\nattack.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, what is it?  What's the matter?\n\nWhen he looks up at her, he's DESOLATE -- his face filled with\nDREAD.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nSomething. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It's all gone blank on\nme.  -- I can't remember the future.\n\nSlowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around\nhim.\n\nLAURIE\nJon.  Let's go back to Earth.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT\nVEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F.\nroom at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring\nmachinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.\n\nInside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON\nOSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY's watch into\nits brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching\nhim from twenty-four years in the future.\n\nVEIDT\nGentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.\n(pause)\nStand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat is it?  How does it work?\n\nVEIDT\nIt's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow\nbackward in time.\n(smiling)\nThere are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing\nparallel to our own --\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian -- you've lost it.\n\nVEIDT\n(pointing at the tachyon bubble)\nI've seen them!  I've seen them in there.\n(pause)\n\nIn some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it\nsurvives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.\n\nHe draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nThe creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war.\n(wild-eyed)\nDo you understand now?  Do you see what I¹m going to do?  I¹m going to change the past!\n\n232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT\nDR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.\n\nLAURIE\nWe¹re too late.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nIt¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- what??\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThe south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.\n\n233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\nInside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY¹s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.\n\nVEIDT\nAt first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.\n\nHe steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.\n\nVEIDT\nIt ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds.\n(turning to face them)\nIn a minute I¹ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I¹ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman¹s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.\n\nDREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.\n\nRORSCHACH\n. . . And they call me a fucking nut.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.\n\nVEIDT\nDon¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?\n\nDREIBERG\nAnd what if you¹re wrong?\n\nVEIDT\nI¹m not.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat if you¹re wrong??\n\nVEIDT\nThen I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!\n(shouting)\nI¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!\n\n234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nA POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThat¹s it.  That¹s the source of the time disturbance.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, where are we?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nVeidt¹s complex.\n\n235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\n\nTwenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler¹s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:\n\nVEIDT\nYour problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years\nchasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . .\nas if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.\n\nDREIBERG\nYou ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist\nbullshit is going to save the world?\n\nVEIDT\nWe'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.\n\nHe kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum.\nThen he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.\n\n236. VEIDT'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS\nIn the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears\na SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .\n\n237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\nA LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon\nbubble.  There's a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up\n--  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the\ntrigger . . .\n\n. . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.\nVEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .\n\n. . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with\nLAURIE at his side.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?\n\nVEIDT\nJon!  Get back!  You don't understand.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees\nhimself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of\nthe I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he's\nsurprised.\n\nIn the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to\nsidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN\nTHE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.\n\nVEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE's directly in his path.  He\nshoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and\npoints his STUN GUN directly at her --\n\n-- and a millisecond later, he¹s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.\n\nVEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN¹s outstretched finger --\n\nVEIDT\nNO!!!!\n\n-- and in the wink of an eye, he¹s VAPORIZED.  All that¹s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.\n\nDREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat was he doing?\n\nDREIBERG\nTrying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nHe was right.\n\nRORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nHe did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It¹s so elegant.  It¹s so obvious.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN¹s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.\n\nLAURIE\nJon --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nSpace and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!\n\nHe lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz\naround his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the\nroom dim; it's as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the\nworld into his own massive frame.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nMy work here is finished . . .\n\nThe others cower.  They sense that something large is about to\nhappen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the\ntest chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the\ntiny\nhole in time.\n\nHe does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS\ninto a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND\nSTEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.\n\n238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\nJON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter\nbewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling\ngloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nDon't be afraid, Jon.  I'll be here with you.\n\nA second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps\nforward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.\n\nFor a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN's frame\nsurrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR.\nMANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the\nchamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across\nthe shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he\nspreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding\nFLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging\nwith nothingness . . .\n\n. . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue\nlight dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he's\nalive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.\n\n239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER\nThe timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of\nhis awed colleagues, who've seen everything through the observation\npanel.\n\nSCIENTIST\nWhat in the name of God . . .\n\nThe SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY,\nsobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As\nshe clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he\nlooks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .\n\nJON\nYour watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --\n\nSCIENTIST II\nLOOK!!\n\nThe SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber .\n. . which isn't there.  Instead, there's a rippling, irregular\nRUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are\nthree odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and\nRORSCHACH.\n\n240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT'S LAB - THE PRESENT\nDREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the\nastounded SCIENTISTS.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat happened -- ?\n\nDREIBERG\nHe saved himself.  He changed the past.\n\nLAURIE\nWhere did he go?\n\nBefore DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to\nTHROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For\na moment everything's back to normal --\n\n-- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they're in begins to\nDISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.\n\nA sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around\nthem, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge\ninto . . .\n\n241. EXT. VORTEX EFFECT\nDREIBERG, LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an\notherdimensional funhouse of sound and color.  If space and time\ncould be compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride, this\nwould be it.  Their bodies contract and distend, warp and elongate;\ntheir tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks; and then, before they\nknow it, they find themselves deposited --\n\n242. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT\n-- smack in the middle of a busy intersection.  The three of them\nmaterialize from nowhere; a southbound VAN swerves to avoid them,\nslamming into a row of parked cars, and a northbound TAXICAB does the\nsame, knocking over a fire hydrant.\n\nLAURIE\nDan, is this -- is this New York??\n\nDREIBERG\nThose cars.  What year is this??\n\nLAURIE\nEverything's changed --\n\nIt's a disorienting world they've landed in.  In fact, it's\nour world, our New York, and everything -- the cars,\nthe clothing, the very look of the city -- seems just a trifle out of\nwhack . . .\n\nRORSCHACH\nHnrrrrr -- we never happened.\n\nBYSTANDERS cluster about, laughing and taunting, highly amused by the\nobvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst.  There are, of\ncourse, no costumed heroes in our world, and their sudden\npresence prompts a Babel of speculation among the onlookers:\nNuts?  Fruits?  Out-of-work actors?\n\nRORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious, who gets a touch too\nclose, and the mood begins to turn hostile.  The CROWD, now grown to\nseveral dozen people, is threatening to block the intersection\naltogether; a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a\nshrill WHISTLE.\n\nDREIBERG\nOh my God, they still ride around on horses!\n\n243. EXT. NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT\nThe same newsstand we've seen all along -- but luckily, here in our\nworld, the headlines are only mildly discouraging: \"RUSSIAN SUMMIT\nTALKS COLLAPSE.\"  Like everyone else, our old friend the NEWS VENDOR\nis gapin at the ruckus on the street.\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nJesus Christ, it must be Halloween.\n\nHis sidekick, the small black KID who reads comic books, points to\nthe befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition.\n\nKID\nShit, man!  It's Rorschach!  And Night Owl!\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nWhat are you talkin' about?\n\nKID\nSuperheroes!  Check it out!\n\nHe thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDOR's hand and races off to\njoin the growing throng of rubberneckers.  The NEWS VENDOR stares\ndown at the costumed characters in the comic book -- \"WATCHMEN\" --\nthen throws a cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the\nstreet.\n\nKID\nAll right!  They must be on a case.\n\n244. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nHORNS BLARE.  ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.  The intersection is mobbed\nwith curious ONLOOKERS.  By now a half-dozen BEAT COPS have arrived\nto clear the streets and restore order.\n\nCOP I\nBreak it up!  Stand back!\n\nCOP II\nCome on, you three.  If this is some kind of publicity stunt --\n\nDREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH have fallen into a tight circle.\nThey don't know what to expect and they're poised for a brawl.  The\ntaunting crowd gives them plenty of room; even the COPS are hesitant\nto advance.\n\nLAURIE\nDan -- what do we do now?\n\nDREIBERG\n(panicked)\nWherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --\n\nLAURIE\nWe'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't\nthey -- ?\n\nRORSCHACH\nThey'd better.\n\nAnd on RORSCHACH's final vicious HISS, we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nTHE END",

We\\'re in the OBSERVATION ROOM inside the statue\\'s head.\\nA TERRORIST holds a crowd of SQUEALING TOURISTS -- men, women,\\nschoolchildren -- at bay with an automatic rifle.  Two others stand\\nby the windows, scanning the harbor for signs of a double-cross; and\\na fourth, the RINGLEADER, speaks into a walkie-talkie.\\n\\nRINGLEADER\\nGood.

In the distance, a TINY SPECK descends from\\nthe clouds and drops, in a perfectly vertical line, toward the head\\nof the statue.  The SWAT CAPTAIN hoists a pair of binoculars:\\n\\nSWAT CAPTAIN\\nShit.  Shit fire!!\\n\\nSWAT COP\\nSir!  What is it?\\n\\n7. POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS\\nA magnified view of the SPECK, which turns out to be a futuristic,\\nblimplike HOVERCRAFT -- the OWLSHIP.\\n\\nSWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)\\nChrist almighty, it\\'s the goddamned Watchmen!\\n\\n8.

What now?\\n\\nHe looks up at a monitor mounted over the controls.  ADRIAN VEIDT,\\nblond scientific wizard, answers pensively from Watchmen HQ:\\n\\nVEIDT\\n(on monitor)\\nLet\\'s take out their communications.  Drop the scrambler.\\n\\n9. EXT.

OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\\nTERRORISTS staring at the portable TV screen; suddenly, it shows\\nnothing but snow.  The RINGLEADER, suspicious, lifts his\\nwalkie-talkie:\\n\\nRINGLEADER\\nHey.  We got a problem here --\\n\\nHe releases the button.  No reply -- only loud, hissing STATIC.\\n\\nRINGLEADER\\nCome in.  Do you read me?  Don\\'t play around with us,\\nGoddammit !\\n\\n11. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT\\nThe SWAT CAPTAIN curses at his useless walkie-talkie.  Teeth bared,\\nhe glowers up at the OWLSHIP and paces the deck in a psychotic\\nfrenzy.\\n\\nSWAT COP\\nIgnorant bastards!  They\\'ve jammed us!\\n\\nSWAT COP II\\nWhat do we do now?\\n\\nSWAT CAPTAIN\\nWe sit here with our thumbs up our butts.  As usual.\\n\\n12. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY\\nA HULKING FIGURE, outfitted in SCUBA GEAR, emerges from the water.\\nThere\\'s an evil-looking RIFLE slung over his shoulder.  As he\\nswaggers toward the base of the statue, he peels off his wetsuit to\\nreveal yet another gaudy COSTUME underneath.\\n\\nSuperhero #4: THE COMEDIAN.  He pins a BADGE to his leather\\nbreastplate; incongruously, it\\'s a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON -- and it\\nmatches his own nasty SMILE as he marches forward into battle.\\n\\n13. INT. BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY\\nA TRIO OF TERRORISTS standing guard near the entrance in the base of\\nthe statue.  They\\'re holding a JANITOR at gunpoint.  One of them is\\nfumbling with his walkie-talkie, which has inexplicably gone\\nhaywire.\\n\\nTERRORIST I\\nBase to head.  Base to head.  Come in!\\n(flustered)\\nI can\\'t get shit!\\n\\nTERRORIST II\\nWhat the hell is going on??\\n\\nThere\\'s a sudden metallic CLANG behind them.  They turn in unison --\\njust as the COMEDIAN struts into frame, assault rifle in hand.\\n\\nPanic.  The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of\\na long metal stairway.  One of them grabs the JANITOR, holds a gun to\\nhis head.\\n\\nTERRORIST I\\nI\\'M NOT JOKING!!\\n\\nThe COMEDIAN shrugs: okay.  He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED\\nSHOTS directly into the JANITOR\\'s gut.  The old man\\'s body jerks twice\\nand he slumps to the floor, stone dead.\\n\\nThe TERRORISTS stand there aghast.  For an instant they\\'re too\\nstunned to shoot.  The COMEDIAN breaks into a dopey grin --\\n\\nCOMEDIAN\\nThe joke\\'s on you.\\n\\n-- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As\\nthe saying goes . . . it\\'s nice to see a man who enjoys his work.\\n\\n14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\\nRORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor\\nof the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --\\n\\n15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\\nA sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to\\nthe nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL\\nFIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.\\n\\nWhile the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point\\nbehind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS\\nand RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the\\nstatue\\'s upraised TORCH.\\n\\nThe TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the\\nfar side of the torch.\\n\\nRINGLEADER\\nI don\\'t like this.  Go downstairs and see what\\'s up.\\n\\n16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY\\nRORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nGot your flashgun?\\n\\nCAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and\\ngoes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits\\nbehind.\\n\\n17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\\nThe COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue\\'s layout.\\nHe spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor,\\nthen strolls over and jimmies it open.\\n\\nANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one\\'s different.\\nThis one\\'s a WOMAN.\\n\\nSILK SPECTRE\\nAbout time.  It stinks down there.\\n\\nCOMEDIAN\\nB-team\\'s upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.\\n\\nAs the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched\\nwetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME\\nunderneath.\\n\\nSILK SPECTRE\\nWhy do I get all the glamour jobs?\\n\\nCOMEDIAN\\nA woman\\'s work is never done.\\n\\n18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY\\nThe TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later,\\nCAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their\\nguns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a\\nTEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.\\n\\nRINGLEADER\\nI don\\'t know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.\\n\\nCAPT. METROPOLIS\\nPlease.  There\\'s something I\\'d like you to see first.\\n\\nHe holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer\\'s flash.\\nAll at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding\\nlight has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the\\nfloor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.\\n\\nAll except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who\\'s wearing his special sunglasses.\\nHe pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.\\n\\n19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER\\nAn edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he\\'s grabbed\\nfrom behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at\\nhis throat.\\n\\nCOMEDIAN\\nOkay, Abdul.  Where\\'s the bomb?\\n\\n20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\\nEveryone\\'s slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the\\nTERRORISTS tied up; he\\'s consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.\\n\\nCAPT. METROPOLIS\\nDon\\'t cry, little one.  You\\'re in good hands.\\n(standing; to the crowd)\\nNow everyone.  Listen carefully.  We\\'re going out through the torch.\\n\\nHe goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the\\ntorch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.\\n\\n21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER\\nA METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH\\nsecures it to the tip of the torch.\\n\\n22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT\\nSILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.\\n\\nSILK SPECTRE\\nShould be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .\\n\\nCOMEDIAN\\nJust barge in.  While they\\'re staring at your tits we\\'ll blow their\\nballs off.\\n\\nThey look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead\\nlanding.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist\\nhits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the\\nlanding.\\n\\n23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER\\nGas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS\\' BOMB, and it\\'s a big fat one, sits\\nin a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with\\nUNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the\\nCOMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:\\n\\nCOMEDIAN\\nWell.  They look distracted.\\n(turning to face her)\\nDon\\'t suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?\\n\\nSILK SPECTRE\\nEddie -- !\\n\\nSuddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He\\nturns.\\n\\nOne of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself\\nover to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A\\nSWITCH on the housing.\\n\\nA TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.\\n\\nCOMEDIAN\\nSHIT!\\n\\nHe hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to\\nblink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An\\nempty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.\\n\\nSILK SPECTRE\\nWhat about the --\\n\\nCOMEDIAN\\nFUCK \\'EM!\\n\\nThere\\'s a mountain-climber\\'s CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it\\naround the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only\\na second before following suit.\\n\\n24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\\nCAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once,\\nhe FREEZES.  There\\'s a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as\\nwell.\\n\\n25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\\nYET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL\\'s instrument panel.\\nHe looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.\\n\\nNIGHT OWL\\nAdrian!\\n\\nVEIDT\\nYeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.\\n\\nNIGHT OWL\\nWell, good God, we can\\'t just --\\n\\nVEIDT\\nMission aborted, Daniel!\\n\\nNIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.\\n\\n26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT\\nOn the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.\\n\\n27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER\\nThe COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS\\nthrowing off sparks against the cable.\\n\\n28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\\nCAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands\\npressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and\\nRORSCHACH, who\\'s hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off\\nthe torch.\\n\\n29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT\\nTHE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE\\ntouches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator\\ndoors open, and the two of them dive through.\\n\\n30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER\\nRORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP\\nstreaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure\\nof Lady Liberty.\\n\\nThree beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.\\n\\n31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\\nA heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an\\noverhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.\\n\\n32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER\\nSmoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat\\nagainst a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling\\nDEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.\\n\\n33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER\\nThe furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of\\nthe statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He\\nturns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.\\n\\nSWAT CAPTAIN\\nThat\\'s it.  I quit.\\n\\nThe water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --\\n\\n34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY\\n-- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through\\nthe harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the\\ndemolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes\\nwondering what the hell happened to his date.\\n\\nMeet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR.\\nMANHATTAN.\\n\\nDown below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact --\\nare crawling out of the wreckage.

HIGH-RISE - NIGHT\\nDarkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we TILT\\nUP the towering facade of a forty-story apartment building.  A BLIMP\\ndrifts lazily through distant clouds; the sounds of traffic echo\\nfaint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse -- where\\nheavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a SHATTERED\\nPLATE-GLASS WINDOW.  SUPER TITLE:\\n\\nNEW YORK CITY - TEN YEARS LATER\\n\\n38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\\nA ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by\\nthe garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the\\nhigh-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated\\nbubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on\\ntheir roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.\\n\\nA CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: \"NEW SKIRMISH ON\\nAFGHAN BORDER.

A plainclothes COP takes a statement from\\nthe DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare\\nwith sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.\\n\\nPATROLMAN\\nSTAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!\\n\\nWe are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of\\nreality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the\\ncity -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance:\\nhis standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his\\nplastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears\\na path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the\\nback of a waiting ambulance.\\n\\nDET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and\\nbuttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the\\ninvestigation.\\n\\nBURNS\\nHad a lot of blood in him.\\n\\nHYDE\\nYou oughta see upstairs.

We got a\\ncall from Washington.\\n\\nHYDE\\nWashington?\\n\\nBURNS\\nThey want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.\\n\\nHYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after\\nthe ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.\\n\\n40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\\n\\nTIGHT ON a large placard: \"THE END IS NIGH.\"  The bearer of the sign,\\na hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk\\nspreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make\\nout an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.\\n\\nThe NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his\\ncollar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against\\nthe kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick,\\ncross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in\\nresponse and plugs on.\\n\\nAt the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the\\nsidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET\\nCRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain\\ngrate.\\n\\nIt\\'s a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its\\nsurface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to\\nmidnight.\\n\\nThe STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.

PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT\\nMOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and\\noverturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture\\nwindow.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are\\nflapping wildly.\\n\\nA ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.\\n\\nSHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps\\ninside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is\\ninvisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the\\nroom.\\n\\nThe apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints,\\ngaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The\\nflashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS\\nand an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.\\n\\nThe INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains\\nof a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky\\nglass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for\\nhis face.\\n\\nHe has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and\\never-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should\\nbe. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.\\n\\nWe\\'ve met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.\\n\\n43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\\nRORSCHACH\\'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk\\ndainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood.\\nOffhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL.\\nHe tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his\\ntrenchcoat pocket.\\n\\n44.

Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on\\nthe wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP.\\nTHUMP.\\n\\nHe pauses.  He\\'s found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully\\nalong the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a\\nCONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing\\na SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.\\n\\nHe reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a\\nbizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit,\\nrows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed\\nPHOTOGRAPH.\\n\\nRORSCHACH examines the photo.  It\\'s a group shot, six men, one woman,\\nall dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is\\nwearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN\\'s\\ncostume.\\n\\nThey\\'re all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT.\\nMETROPOLIS.  DR.

STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT\\nA LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner\\nstore.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with\\nthe heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated\\n-- old before his time.\\n\\nHe holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough\\nto open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.\\n\\n46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT\\nIn an alleyway just off the access street, there\\'s a MUGGING in\\nprogress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in\\nknot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG\\nsees what\\'s happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious\\ndecision to move on.  Then --\\n\\nVOICE\\nHold up, papa-san!\\n\\nThe KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and\\nspotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they\\nmarch toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them,\\nalmost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n47. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE\\nSlow-mo, double-frame, or sepia-tone; you call it.  But whatever the\\ngimmick, it should suggest that the events we\\'re watching take place\\nin a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.\\n\\nIt\\'s out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in\\nan alleyway not unlike the one we\\'ve just left.  There\\'s a flurry of\\nfists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--\\n\\n-- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME,\\ntransporting us back to:\\n\\n48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT\\nReal-time again.  Our reverie\\'s been interrupted by a SHAFT OF\\nWHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the\\nalley.\\n\\nLOUDSPEAKER\\nHALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --\\n\\nThe KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the\\nLIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair\\nsome forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of\\nthe kids.\\n\\nDREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the\\nalleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past\\nhelp.\\n\\n49. INT. DREIBERG\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\\nTHREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The\\nsecurity system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN\\'s\\napartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.\\n\\nDREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs\\nit carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for\\nthe kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most\\npeculiar sight:\\n\\nDREIBERG\\n. . . Rorschach.\\n\\n50. INT. DREIBERG\\'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\\nLeaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is\\nthe aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up,\\nexposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he\\'s calmly eating a plate of\\nbaked beans.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nHow did you get in here?\\n\\nIgnoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping,\\nutterly emotionless whisper:\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nHiya, pardner.  Long time no see.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nDid anybody follow you?  See you come here?\\n\\nDREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn\\'t care less --\\nemits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can\\nonto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup\\nfrom a squeeze bottle.\\n\\nDREIBERG (cont.)\\nI can\\'t believe you\\'re back on the streets.  Good God, man, you\\'re\\nwanted on fourteen counts of murder.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nAt least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.\\n\\nHe reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it\\nto DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his\\nfingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.\\n\\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\\nLook familiar?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nSure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nHuman bean juice.\\n(beat)\\nThe Comedian is dead.\\n\\nDREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture.\\nHis jaw goes slack.\\n\\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\\nHad a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up --\\nbeautiful view.\\nHope he enjoyed it on the way down.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nJesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?\\n\\nRORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.\\n\\nDREIBERG (cont.)\\nWell, God, he\\'d been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he\\nmust\\'ve had enemies.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nSo do I.  So do you.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nRorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that\\'s just\\nparanoia.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\'s head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG\\nblinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But\\nRORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the\\nfront door.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nMaybe.  Or maybe somebody\\'s finally caught up with us.  Somebody with\\na grudge.\\n(pause)\\nThought you might want to spread the word.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nHey.  Hey.  If you don\\'t mind, use the back stairs, all right?\\n\\nRORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He\\nopens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nYou the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.\\n\\nHe reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo\\nfrom the COMEDIAN\\'s wall.  A moment later, he\\'s gone.\\n\\nDREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone,\\nCAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple\\ntunic and mask . . .\\n\\n51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT\\nA GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is\\nfar from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome\\ndesk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is\\nADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he\\'s\\nDREIBERG\\'s age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and\\npale, he looks thirty.  When he\\'s sixty he\\'ll look forty.\\n\\nVEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic\\npatents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his\\noffice reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the\\nlike.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE\\nRINGS.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nVeidt here.\\n\\n52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT\\nDREIBERG\\nAdrian?  Listen, it\\'s Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach.\\nI had to call you before he --\\n\\nVEIDT\\nDaniel, slow down.  What\\'s this about Rorschach?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nThe Comedian.  He\\'s dead.  Murdered.  That\\'s all I know.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nMy God.  Murdered?  -- What\\'s this have to do with Rorschach?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nIt\\'s -- he\\'s got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone\\'s\\n. . . I don\\'t know, stalking us.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nUs.  You mean the Watchmen.\\n\\nThe big CAT purrs; it\\'s a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red\\nfur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a\\nchunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders\\nDREIBERG\\'s words.\\n\\nVEIDT (cont.)\\nDaniel, Rorschach is insane.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nI know, I know, it\\'s just -- he\\'s back on the street, he smells\\nblood.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nYou know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs\\n-- then he\\'s satisfied.  It blows over.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nHe\\'s bound to get caught.  I don\\'t want my name coming out.  Not at\\nthis late date.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nIf he comes here, I\\'ll handle him.  Remember -- I\\'ve always protected\\nyou.  Haven\\'t I?\\n(slight pause)\\nDo you need money?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nNo.  I just wanted you to --\\n\\nVEIDT\\nYou did the right thing, Daniel.  Let\\'s stay in touch, okay?  Good\\nnight.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nGood night.\\n\\nVEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a\\ncigarette.  It\\'s \"matchless\"; you ignite it guy striking the tip of\\nthe cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a\\nlong, slow drag.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\\nBarbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the\\ncheckpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE\\nrolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign\\nwhich reads \"ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER.\"\\n\\n54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\\nADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED\\nESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door\\nwith a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a\\nsix-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .\\n\\n. . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple\\ndoorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and\\nwait -- to VEIDT\\'s great amusement.\\n\\nThe inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned\\nwoman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK\\nSPECTRE.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nAdrian.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nLaurie!  Good to see you.\\n\\nShe gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall\\nin perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.\\n\\nLAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized\\nmachines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific\\nparaphernalia of every description.\\n\\nVEIDT (cont.)\\nNice.  Who\\'s your decorator -- Edward Teller?\\n\\nLAURIE\\nDon\\'t rub it in.  I live here.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nAnd how\\'s life with the walking H-bomb?\\n\\nLAURIE\\nHe\\'s in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.\\n\\nShe takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT\\nwanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A\\nSMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:\\n\\nVEIDT\\nHi, Jon.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)\\n(a deep, booming voice)\\nHello, Adrian.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under\\nany circumstances, but at the moment he\\'s downright gargantuan.\\nForty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he\\'s calmly adjusting a\\ncalibration atop his particle accelerator.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\\nI think I\\'m about to detect a gluino.\\n\\nIn case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just\\nabout anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the\\nphysical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of\\ntime and space, DR.

Say, I understand old Schwartzmann\\ncaught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .\\n\\nLAURIE, who\\'s just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nPlease, you guys, no shop talk.\\n(to DR. MANHATTAN)\\nJon, you\\'re being rude.  Why don\\'t you shrivel on down and join us?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable\\nsix-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist\\n-- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:\\n\\nLAURIE (cont.)\\nGood to see you, Adrian.  What\\'s the occasion?\\n\\nHe tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO\\nSURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.\\n\\nVEIDT\\n. . . Are we being monitored?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the\\nlittle red \"ON\" lights wink out.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nThe bearer of bad news.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nWe\\'ve lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nBlake?  Dead?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nYes.  I heard this morning.  Washington\\'s asked me to attend the\\nfuneral as a matter of protocol.\\n\\nLAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first\\nshe\\'s heard about it.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nRorschach\\'s on the case.  He\\'s got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to\\nthink that someone is \"stalking\" the Watchmen.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nOh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nWhat\\'s your theory?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nLife and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don\\'t concern\\nme.\\n\\nVEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is\\nconsiderably less amused.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nI could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?\\n\\nVEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another\\npart of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as\\nwe watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and\\nfloats off to one side.\\n\\nA module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of\\nthe hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in\\nmidair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn\\'t lifted a finger; he\\'s dismantling and\\nreassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.\\n\\nVEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes\\nthe conversation without missing a beat:\\n\\nVEIDT\\nI guess you\\'ll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nYou mean Afghanistan?\\n(beat)\\nIt won\\'t require my attention.  What I\\'m doing here is far more\\ninteresting.\\n\\nThe module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The\\ncover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws\\nitself shut.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nWell . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as\\nusual -- I can\\'t tell you anything you don\\'t already know.  Goodbye,\\nJon.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds\\nhis coat where LAURIE put it.  He\\'s just about to leave when she\\narrives with two stiff drinks in hand.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nAdrian!  Don\\'t leave so soon.  I --\\n\\nVEIDT\\nI\\'ll take a raincheck, Laurie.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nPlease.\\n\\nThere\\'s a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his\\nshoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who\\'s forty feet tall again, playing\\nwith his superaccelerator.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nHe\\'s a little farther gone every time.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nStay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to\\nsomeone human.\\n(beat)\\nHe doesn\\'t think like we do.  He doesn\\'t even feel what we feel.  I\\nmean -- he even scares the research teams.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nLaurie -- he\\'s the most powerful man who\\'s ever lived.  He\\'s changed\\nthe world.\\n\\nLAURIE\\n(embarrassed)\\nI know.  I shouldn\\'t be saying this.  He\\'s happy, he\\'s content, he\\'s\\ndoing his work --\\n\\nVEIDT\\nWhat about you?\\n\\nLAURIE\\nI suppose I\\'m serving my purpose, aren\\'t I.\\n(pause)\\nI\\'ll ring for the guards.\\n\\nShe goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her,\\nconcerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest\\npocket for a cigarette case:\\n\\nVEIDT\\nNasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.\\n(handing her a cigarette)\\nDarling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don\\'t you give\\nDaniel a call?  I\\'m sure he\\'d be glad to hear from you.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nMaybe I\\'ll do that.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nI\\'m sorry about Blake.\\n\\nHe pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS\\nappear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.\\n\\nLAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman\\nlover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and\\nWALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren\\'t there.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY\\'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT\\nA decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood,\\npopular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow\\nstairway which dips well below street level.\\n\\n56. INT. HAPPY HARRY\\'S - NIGHT\\nThe usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS\\nhover at the entrance to the men\\'s room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS\\nstand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and\\ngrind.  Suddenly there\\'s a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.\\n\\nOver by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE\\noff the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of\\nvicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the\\nbar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing\\nglasses.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nHarry.\\n\\nHARRY\\n(petrified)\\nR-Rorschach.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nPhone\\'s out of order.  Mind if I use yours?\\n\\nHe reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH\\npicks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS\\nand yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.\\n\\nHe turns and faces the assembled multitudes:\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nEdward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might\\'ve had\\nhelp.\\n(wandering through the room)\\nThought maybe you could fill me in.\\n\\nENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as\\nRORSCHACH strolls past.\\n\\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\\nYou.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing?\\n(moving on)\\nJohnny Gobs.  What\\'s new at the schoolyard?\\n\\nBehind RORSCHACH\\'s back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively\\ntoward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar,\\nyanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.\\n\\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\\nNicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?\\n\\nNICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH\\nextends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --\\n\\n-- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He\\ncloses a gloved fist around NICKY\\'s pinky finger, twists it back and\\nSNAPS IT.\\n\\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\\nEdward Blake.  Who killed him?\\n\\nNo answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH\\ngrabs his index finger and repeats the process.\\n\\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\\nWho killed Edward Blake?\\n\\nNICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to\\nthe floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He\\'s standing poised to let\\nfly at NICKY\\'s ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.\\n\\nVOICE\\nJESUS!  HE\\'S IN SHOCK!!\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nTHE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?\\n\\nBy now HARRY\\'s pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar.\\nWithout looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It\\ncatches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of\\nglassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the\\nceiling.\\n\\nSILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH\\'s next move.  He\\nlooks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:\\n\\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\\nSo many vermin . . . so little time.\\n\\nHe bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY\\'s quivering frame, and tosses it\\ncontemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long\\nenough to HISS at the crowd:\\n\\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\\nGo back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I\\'ll be\\naround.\\n\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN\\nThe bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller\\nresearch complex.  It\\'s not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and\\nLAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over\\nto where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is\\nempty.\\n\\nLAURIE\\n(muttering; groggy)\\nJon . . . ?\\n\\nA LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE\\ncloses her eyes and sighs.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI\\'m here, Laurie.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nIs it time?  D\\'you have to leave for the funeral?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nNot yet, there\\'s plenty of time.\\n\\nA SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly.\\nDR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nMmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?\\n\\nThe BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE\\'s shoulder and arm,\\ntoward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nWould you like me to stay?\\n\\nLAURIE\\nMm hmm.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI could stay and go.\\n\\nLAURIE\\n. . . And just how would you manage that?\\n\\nShe leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its\\ndownward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is\\nmassaging LAURIE\\'s thigh.\\n\\nThird blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE\\'s eyes go suddenly\\nwide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the\\nfoot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nAAAAAAAAAA!!\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN I\\nLaurie?  Are you --\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN II\\nDon\\'t be upset.\\n\\nThis unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE\\'s\\nfragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a\\ndressing gown.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nJon, please.  I don\\'t enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one\\nperson again, please?\\n\\nThe big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical\\ngestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN I\\nLaurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN II\\n-- you would find it erotic.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nAll right, all right.  It\\'s just -- my nerves, I\\'m going stir-crazy\\nin this place, I --\\n\\nWhile fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance\\nthrough a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment,\\nshe sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an\\nexperiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through\\nthe door . . .\\n\\n58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER\\n. . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:\\n\\nLAURIE\\nYou\\'ve been out here all along, haven\\'t you?  Running one of your\\nstupid experiments --\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN III\\nYes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nSo you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how\\ncould you do this?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN III\\nYou seem to feel I\\'ve been neglecting you.  Isn\\'t that the case?\\n(pause)\\nI thought I\\'d solved the problem quite elegantly.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThat\\'s all it is to you, isn\\'t it?  Just another problem you\\ncan --\\n\\nShe doesn\\'t see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered\\nthe room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:\\n\\nDR. MANHATTANS I & II\\nLaurie, please --\\n\\nLAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back\\nslowly, steadies herself on a lab table.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nJon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I\\ncould really use the time alone.\\n\\nShe storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I &\\nII -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original\\nDR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his\\nequipment.\\n\\nFADE THROUGH TO:\\n\\n1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT\\nA pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard\\nat work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly\\nbeautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it\\'s largely\\nwasted on her preoccupied date.\\n\\nAt the moment, she\\'s filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThe government\\'s really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I\\nguess it\\'s no picnic being the world\\'s only superhuman.\\n(mock-macho)\\nI have to keep him in line.\\n\\nShe flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to\\nlaugh.  He doesn\\'t.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has\\nwandered off into a far corner of the room.\\n\\nLAURIE (cont.)\\nExcuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nSorry, it\\'s this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don\\'t really think\\nanyone\\'s out to get us -- do you?\\n\\nLAURIE\\nDan, are you really that paranoid?  Let\\'s face it, Eddie Blake was no\\nMother Teresa.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nPsychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .\\n\\nLAURIE\\nNow wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the\\ngovernment or do time.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nFine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It\\'s a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty\\ntricks -- political assassinations --\\n\\nNow he\\'s got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then\\nleans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:\\n\\nLAURIE\\nOkay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us\\nmade other choices.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\n(shaking his head in disgust)\\n\\nYeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors\\n. . . and I\\'m still in the psycho file with Rorschach.\\n\\nLAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.\\n\\nDREIBERG (cont.)\\nWhat\\'s so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?\\n\\nLAURIE\\nI\\'m just wondering what you would\\'ve said ten years ago if you could\\nsee yourself right now.\\n(raising her glass)\\nWell, here\\'s to the Comedian.  \\'Cause the fact is, he\\'s dead . . .\\nand we\\'re not.\\n\\nDREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.\\n\\n1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT\\nDREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace,\\nwhich overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They\\'re holding big snifters\\nof brandy, and they\\'re both pretty well drunk.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nThe pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I\\nmean, we were heroes!\\n\\nLAURIE\\nDamn straight.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nDamn straight!  We were heroes.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nOf course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nWell, that was Adrian\\'s idea.  I know he\\'s the smartest man in the\\nworld and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .\\n\\nLAURIE\\n(smiling)\\nHey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma?\\nWhat was his name . . .\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nOh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we\\'d\\nbeat him up?\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThat\\'s the one.  Whatever happened to him?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\n(deadpan)\\nHe pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an\\nelevator shaft.\\n\\nLAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to\\nher mouth -- and like DREIBERG she\\'s GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA\\nPULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a\\nstentorian VOICE over scene:\\n\\nCHAPLAIN (V.O.)\\nIn the midst of life we are in death . . .\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY\\nAN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.\\n\\nCHAPLAIN\\n. . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall\\nchange our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --\\n\\nTIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of\\nmourners.  There\\'s no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the\\nattendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons\\nof protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off\\nwith the traditional twenty-one gun salute.\\n\\nCHAPLAIN (cont.)\\n-- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all\\nthings unto himself.\\n\\nA light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR.\\nMANHATTAN, of course, doesn\\'t need one -- the raindrops vanish\\nmiraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the\\ndistance, and he glances off at:\\n\\n60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT\\nSENTRIES stand at attention.  They\\'ve blocked off the part of the\\ncemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has\\nbeen spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like\\nwildfire.\\n\\nMOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the\\ncemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due\\nrespect for the dead, Arlington National\\'s turning into a zoo:\\ngawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their\\nhands full managing the crowd.\\n\\nA KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to\\njoin the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the\\nVIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.\\n\\nIt\\'s not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled\\nmarble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward,\\nand he\\'s cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms,\\nPieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze\\nplaque bears the inscription:\\n\\nIN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS\\nWHO GAVE THEIR LIVES\\nTO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM\\n\\nBelow it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four\\nhundred of them.\\n\\n61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\\nThe Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE\\'s home sweet\\nhome.  Her car pulls up to the guard\\'s booth and he waves her\\nthrough.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind\\nher, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.\\n\\n62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT\\nLAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex,\\nfumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the\\ncard into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.\\n\\nShe tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls\\nup behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps\\nout.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nMajor Adamson, I can\\'t seem to get in the door.\\n\\nADAMSON\\nLaurie, I\\'ll have to ask you to come with me.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWhy?  What\\'s the problem?\\n\\nADAMSON\\nI can\\'t tell you that.  It is quite urgent.\\n\\nLAURIE\\n(chuckling)\\nI would like to use the bathroom --\\n\\nAs she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.\\n\\nADAMSON\\nThe access code\\'s been changed.  Your card won\\'t work anymore.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWhat?!\\n\\nADAMSON\\nPlease.\\n\\nThe major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The\\nGUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.\\n\\nADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE\\'s climbing inside when she\\nsees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.\\n\\nThe entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging\\nfrom it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION\\nSUITS.\\n\\n63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT\\nLAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to\\na team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard\\nat the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white\\ngown:\\n\\nNURSE\\nMiss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWhat -- ?\\n\\nDOCTOR\\nDrink this.\\n\\nThe DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She\\nstares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.\\n\\nDOCTOR\\nDrink it.\\n\\n64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT\\nTECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are\\nshifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of\\na human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens\\non:\\n\\n65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT\\nWe\\'re watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A\\ndonut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot,\\nfoot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to\\nthe anteroom.\\n\\nThrough a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head\\nwedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right\\nas she wonders just what the hell is going on.\\n\\n66. INT. DOCTOR\\'S OFFICE - NIGHT\\nA MAN\\'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.\\n\\nLAURIE (O.S.)\\nThat\\'s Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon\\'s military liaison.\\n\\nLAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table\\nsurrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent\\nSCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken\\nfrom a thick sheaf.\\n\\nLAURIE (cont.)\\nDr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon\\'s research teams.  The\\nquantum-whatever.\\n\\nSCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It\\'s a group shot of the\\nWatchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE\\'s closet.  LAURIE\\nhesitates.\\n\\nLAURIE (cont.)\\nThat\\'s Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt.\\n(long pause)\\nRorschach . . .\\n\\nSCHMIDT\\nTheir real names, please.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nI don\\'t know their real names.\\n\\nSCHMIDT\\nYou\\'re lying, Miss Juspeczyk.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nI don\\'t know their real names!\\n\\nSCHMIDT\\nYou\\'re not \"protecting\" anyone.  These people\\'s lives may depend on\\nthe answers you give.\\n(holding up the sheaf of photos)\\nThese are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThen why don\\'t you ask him?!?\\n\\nFurious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby\\nwindow.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced\\ntorturers, they understand the value of patience.\\n\\nLAURIE (cont.)\\nI want to get dressed.  -- And I\\'d like a cigarette.\\n\\nOne of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out\\nfor LAURIE.  As he\\'s lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door\\nopens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.\\n\\nHe passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and\\ntilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with\\ncuriosity:\\n\\nLAURIE (cont.)\\nSomeone had better tell me what\\'s going on here!\\n\\nSCHMIDT\\nSit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file\\nare all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else\\nin common as well.\\n(beat)\\nThey\\'ve all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWhat are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?\\n\\nAll at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE\\'s face goes\\nbone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she\\ntakes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she\\'s read.\\n\\nSCHMIDT\\nI\\'m terribly sorry.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWhat does this mean?  What does it --\\n\\nSCHMIDT\\nSix to eight months.  That\\'s with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can\\nsee why it\\'s so vital that we locate your . . . friends.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThat\\'s it.  This is all a trick, isn\\'t it?  Some kind of horrible\\njoke to make me --\\n\\nShe scans the room.  No one\\'s laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to\\nhis comrades, and heads for the door.\\n\\nSCHMIDT\\nTake a day or two.  If you \"remember\" any names . . . do give us a\\ncall.\\n\\nThe AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches\\nfor the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking,\\nshe buries her face in her hands.\\n\\n67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\\nA darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a\\ntwo-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who\\'s been\\nwatching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.\\n\\nADAMSON\\nPoor kid.\\n\\nSCHMIDT\\nWe\\'ll keep her in isolation awhile.  She\\'ll give us some names.\\n\\nADAMSON\\nTo hell with those costumed idiots.  I\\'m worried about Doc\\nManhattan.\\n\\nSCHMIDT\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nADAMSON\\nShe\\'s his last link to humanity.  Once she\\'s gone . . . God knows\\nwhich way he\\'ll jump.\\n\\nDISSOLVE TO:\\n\\n68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY\\nDR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He\\'s wearing\\na navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie\\nwith an irregular mauve pattern.\\n\\nThe tie doesn\\'t quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie\\nmagically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal\\ngold stripes.\\n\\nToo staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into\\na handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for\\ndecoration.\\n\\nIt does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the\\nmirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.\\n\\n69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY\\nTECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green\\nroom, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.\\n\\nDIRECTOR\\nWe\\'re on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is\\nthat big blue son of a --\\n\\nHe stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just\\nrematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR\\'s\\nface.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI\\'m sorry.  Am I late?\\n\\nDIRECTOR\\nNo problem.  We\\'ll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I\\'m\\nKent Turner, the director. . .\\n\\nThe DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN\\'s hand and marches him down a\\nhallway.  Within seconds they\\'re joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.\\n\\nLIAISON\\nDr. Osterman.  I\\'ve got a list of taboo areas here we\\'d like you to\\nsteer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you\\'ll\\njust play it cool --\\n\\nDIRECTOR\\nDoc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give\\nus something a little darker . . . ?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nWill this do?\\n\\nDIRECTOR\\nPerfect.\\n\\nLIAISON\\nNow Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --\\n\\nBut the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by\\na cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are\\nhurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON\\nhangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The \"ABC NEWS\\nSPECIAL REPORT\" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC\\nunderneath.\\n\\n70. INSERT - TV MONITOR\\nStock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for\\ntheir lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right\\nand takes in an extraordinary sight.\\n\\nA towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through\\nthe jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the\\ngreenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts\\nof automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation\\ncrew does his apocalypse thing.

MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds\\na corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.\\n\\nHis EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey\\ngunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM\\nhisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met\\nwith a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads:\\n\"CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968.\"\\n\\nANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)\\n-- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a\\none-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding\\nthe Communist menace in check.\\n\\nDANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from\\nAmerican Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake\\nhands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a\\nthree-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic\\naccord.  Title: \"NICARAGUA.  1979.\"\\n\\nANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)\\nIn the famous words of General William Westmoreland, \"Yes, Virginia,\\nthere is a Superman -- and thank God, he\\'s American.\"\\n\\n71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\\nA sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop\\nof the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded\\nnews vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host\\'s chair:\\n\\nBRINKLEY\\nFor this live question-and-answer session we\\'ll be joined by\\ncorrespondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating,\\nI\\'ll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy.\\n(turning)\\nNow let\\'s welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better\\nknown to the world as Dr. Manhattan.\\n\\nApplause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at\\nBRINKLEY\\'s right.  He nods in acknowledgement.\\n\\nBRINKLEY (cont.)\\nI suppose the topic on everyone\\'s mind this week is Afghanistan,\\nwhere Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now\\nsince you\\'ve dealt successfully with similar situations in the past .\\n. . I\\'ll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that\\nyou intervene?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI will not intervene in Afghanistan.\\n\\nA HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.\\n\\n72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\\nLooking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.\\n\\n73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN\\nHANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience.\\nBRINKLEY ignores them:\\n\\nBRINKLEY\\nYou\\'re saying you would refuse a direct request?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nThere will be no request.  I will not intervene.\\n\\nBRINKLEY\\nWell, Doctor, it\\'s widely understood, or rumored, that you can\\nactually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the\\nhostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?\\n\\n74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\\nHe\\'s steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he\\'s hanging on\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\'s every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE\\nin the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:\\n\\nLIAISON\\nI want a phone line to the booth.  Now.\\n\\n75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it.\\n(long pause)\\nI can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will\\nnot intervene.\\n\\nHe sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.\\n\\nBRINKLEY\\nWell, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I\\'ll\\nopen up the floor to questions now.  Doug?\\n\\nREPORTER\\nDr. Osterman, I\\'m Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I\\'d like to read\\nyou some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M.\\nWeaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nAll friends, yes.  Associates of mine.\\n\\nROTH\\nLet me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White.\\nAre you aware that these \"friends\" and \"associates\" of yours have all\\nbeen diagnosed with terminal cancer?\\n\\nThe CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY\\'s taken aback.  He\\ngapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face\\nan unreadable mask.\\n\\n76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\\neyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone\\n\\nLIAISON\\nOh Jesus.\\n(barking into phone)\\nI want this broadcast killed.  I\\'ll run out on that goddamn set if I\\nhave to!\\n\\n77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN\\nROTH\\nI have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly\\ndiagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a\\nconnection?\\n\\nBy now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make\\nhimself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who\\'s just gotten a message\\nfrom the booth, touches his headset and announces:\\n\\nBRINKLEY\\nI\\'m told it\\'s time for a break.  We\\'ll be back after this brief\\nmessage --\\n\\nWithin seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set,\\nflanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.\\n\\nLIAISON\\nTHAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW\\'S OVER!!\\n\\nThe three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then,\\nPANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB\\nTHE SET.\\n\\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\\nDr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause\\ncancer??\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI don\\'t wish to answer any questions.\\n\\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\\nYou see the future!  Did you know in advance --\\n\\nLIAISON\\nThe Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP\\nASIDE!!\\n\\nThe LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but\\nthe mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.\\n\\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\\nHow long have you known -- why is the government concealing this\\ninformation --\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nPlease get out of my way.\\n\\nThe LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor.\\nSCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it\\'s getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN\\nlets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI said LEAVE ME ALONE!!\\n\\nIn the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no\\nmicrophones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR.\\nMANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.\\n\\nBRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later,\\nthere\\'s an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES,\\nleaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT\\nThe place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is\\noverseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post\\nquarantine notices at the entrances.  He\\'s not altogether surprised\\nwhen DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nWhere\\'s Laurie?\\n\\nADAMSON backs off slightly.  He\\'s not wearing a radiation suit, and\\nhe\\'s understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely\\nnecessary.\\n\\nADAMSON\\nShe\\'s been relocated, Jon.  It\\'s strictly precautionary . . .\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nThere\\'s no need to lie.  I assume she\\'s been tested.  Were the\\nresults positive?\\n\\nADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\\nDon\\'t bother.  I already know what you\\'ll say.\\n\\nHe watches impassively as what\\'s left of his home is dismantled.  His\\nmind is already a million miles away.\\n\\nADAMSON\\nJon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . .\\ncould you cure her?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI don\\'t know.  I only know that I won\\'t.\\n(long pause)\\nThere\\'d be no point.  It\\'s finally begun.\\n\\nADAMSON\\n\"Begun?\"  What\\'s begun?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI\\'ve seen this day.  It\\'s the day I\\'ve been dreading all these years.\\n(pause)\\nYou see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I\\ncared for . . .\\n\\nADAMSON doesn\\'t know what he\\'s talking about, but a chill runs down\\nhis spine nonetheless.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nMy work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.\\n\\nAnd with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves\\nbehind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at\\nthe Major\\'s feet.\\n\\nADAMSON\\nGood Lord --\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n79. EXT. OUTER SPACE\\n-- and it\\'s about as exterior as you can get.  We\\'re a few\\nhundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily\\napparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily\\nbeautiful\\n-- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white\\nclouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing\\nour planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.\\n\\nIt\\'s DR. MANHATTAN.  He\\'s in a lotus position, sitting on\\nnothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage.\\nStars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he\\'s about to\\nleave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.\\n\\n80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT\\nBlack sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so\\nbarren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is,\\nuntil we see the residue of man\\'s presence on the landscape: ruined\\nquonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements,\\nhalf-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than\\nhusks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a\\nrotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.\\n\\nA gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden\\nRUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue\\nlight.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift\\nin the sky and descends gently to earth.\\n\\nThe rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once\\nmore as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town\\nof Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was\\nonce a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long\\nmahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.\\n\\nA desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We\\nMOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and\\n\\nDISSOLVE TO:\\n\\n81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY\\nIt\\'s twenty-odd years ago, and we\\'re looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN\\n-- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie\\nand a white lab coat.  He\\'s at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing\\na dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:\\n\\nJANEY SLATER (O.S.)\\nNineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You\\'d think they\\ncould at least make us a decent hamburger.\\n\\nJON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He\\'s utterly smitten\\nwith DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she\\'s a couple\\nof years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just\\nclose enough to LAURIE that you\\'d notice the resemblance.  And she\\'s\\nprobably the only one in the room who can\\'t see just how bad a crush\\nJON has on her.\\n\\nJON\\nI\\'ll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I\\'m gonna\\nhead straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.\\n\\nJANEY\\nWith lots of ketchup?\\n\\nSmiling, she indicates JON\\'s plate.  He\\'s emptied at least half a\\nbottle on his french fries.\\n\\nJON\\nNothing wrong with ketchup.\\n\\nJANEY\\nJon Osterman, you don\\'t act like a Princeton boy.  What\\'s a big lug\\nlike you doing in a place like this?\\n\\nJON\\nAnything for science, I guess.\\n(long, hesitant pause)\\nJaney, there\\'s something --\\n\\nJANEY\\n(simultaneously)\\nWe should get back --\\n(realizing she\\'s cut him off)\\nWhat?\\n\\nJON\\nNothing.  What were you going to say?\\n\\nJANEY\\nWe should get back to the lab.\\n(staring at him; chuckling)\\nYou okay, Jon?\\n\\nHe stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he\\npipes up:\\n\\nJON\\nOh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I\\'ll be right behind you.\\n\\nThe lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads\\nfor the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after\\nJANEY.  She\\'s paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.\\n\\nHis face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up\\nbehind her.\\n\\nJANEY\\nStupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --\\n\\nJON\\n(blurting it out)\\nJaney, will you marry me?\\n\\nShe turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He\\'s wearing the\\npained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the\\nverdict.\\n\\nJANEY\\nJon -- what?\\n\\nJON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes\\nlocked.  For a moment it\\'s as if they\\'re the only souls in the\\ncanteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the\\ndoor, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and\\none of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled\\nJANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.\\n\\nThere\\'s a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private\\ntrance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.\\n\\nWALLY\\nChrist, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.\\n\\nJANEY\\nOh Wally, don\\'t feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --\\n\\nJON\\nI can fix it.\\n\\nJANEY\\n-- What?\\n\\nJON\\nMy dad\\'s a watchmaker.  I\\'ll put it back together for you.  Better\\nthan ever.\\n\\nHe holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.\\n\\nWALLY\\nTake him up on it.  It\\'d make me feel better.\\n\\nChuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY\\nhands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her\\nwith basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he\\'s still waiting for his\\nanswer.\\n\\nBut before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket.\\nHe thrusts it abruptly into JANEY\\'s hands --\\n\\nJON\\nHere.  I\\'ll trade you.\\n\\n-- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING.\\nWith a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but\\nhe\\'s already gone.\\n\\nShe stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.\\n\\n82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY\\nJON\\'s at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center\\nof the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER\\'S\\nTOOLS.\\n\\nIt\\'s his lunch hour, and he\\'s fixing JANEY\\'s watch.  He tightens the\\ncentral screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal\\ninto its housing and gives it a light tap.\\n\\nWith a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy\\'s in love,\\nremember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed\\nwith oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST\\nCHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of\\nit are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like\\nanti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.\\n\\nHe stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and\\nwalks over to grab it.  As he\\'s putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK\\nfrom the direction of the test chamber.\\n\\nMounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes,\\nseconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it\\'s 13:58 and change.  JON\\neyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to\\nthe reinforced steel door of the chamber.\\n\\nInside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a\\nlow platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it\\nhears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY\\'s watch on the\\nconcrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.\\n\\nJON\\nC\\'mon, little guy, outta here . . .\\n\\nThe mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in\\nhand.\\n\\nJON (cont.)\\n. . . don\\'t wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.\\n\\nHe stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he\\'s left the watch\\ninside.\\n\\nHe looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting.\\nAgitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the\\ndoorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of\\nthe concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete\\nblock, reaches for the watch --\\n\\n-- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.\\n\\nWhite-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete\\nblock -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of\\nthe support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.\\n\\nBefore his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place --\\nTRAPPING HIM INSIDE.\\n\\nHe LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps\\nsliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams\\nshut.\\n\\n83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT\\n1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One\\nof them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of\\nMILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the\\nfacilities.\\n\\nSCIENTIST\\n-- actually, we don\\'t know what happens when you disrupt the\\nintrinsic field.  All we\\'ve managed to do so far is blow a few\\nconcrete blocks all to hell.\\n\\nGENERAL\\n(joking, but worried)\\nNo danger of . . . fallout, is there?\\n\\nSCIENTIST\\nNo sir.  The chamber\\'s radiation-proof once it\\'s sealed.  That\\'s why\\nwe waited outside.\\n\\nThe translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a\\ndull red.\\n\\nThe crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There\\'s a dim, distant\\nTHUMPING.\\n\\nThe SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect\\nunison.\\n\\nGENERAL\\nWhat\\'s the matter?\\n\\nSCIENTIST\\nSweet Jesus -- !\\n\\nWe DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of\\nthe test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the\\nterrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass,\\nscreaming soundlessly.\\n\\nPandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left,\\npunching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes\\nto a belated and painfully obvious realization:\\n\\nGENERAL\\nSay, there\\'s a man in there!!\\n\\nThe coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One\\nSCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --\\n\\nSCIENTIST I\\nStay calm, Jon!  We\\'ll try and kill the power!\\n\\n-- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:\\n\\nSCIENTIST II\\nBuilding six!  Kill the power!  Osterman\\'s trapped in the I.F.\\nchamber!!\\n\\nThe GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.\\n\\nGENERAL\\nWell -- why doesn\\'t someone let him out??\\n\\nSCIENTIST III\\nIt\\'s a timelock.  It can\\'t be opened once the sequence\\nstarts.\\n(to SCIENTIST II)\\nWhat\\'s the word?\\n\\nSCIENTIST II\\n(covering the phone)\\nThey\\'re sending a crew to the generator building --\\n\\nSCIENTIST IV\\nTWENTY SECONDS!\\n\\nIn a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions \"IN\\nCASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS.\"  WALLY WEAVER, Jon\\'s friend from the\\ncanteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the\\nglass, and grabs the ax.\\n\\nSCIENTIST I\\nWally!  What are you doing?\\n\\nWALLY\\nThe power cables!!\\n\\nAnd now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY\\nSLATER.\\n\\nJANEY\\nAm I late for the --\\n\\nShe stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the\\nlab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back\\nthrough the door.\\n\\nSCIENTIST III\\nJaney!  Get her out of here.  Get out!\\n\\nBut she resists.  She\\'s just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to\\ntake a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils\\nhave just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.\\n\\nJANEY\\nWhat in the name of -- where\\'s Jon?\\n\\nSCIENTIST III\\nJaney!  Please!  Go!!\\n\\nWALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a\\nsudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a\\nwall.\\n\\nSparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white\\nlight.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look\\nat the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.\\n\\nJANEY\\nJon.\\n\\n84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\\nJON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his\\nface.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch,\\nwhich he\\'s been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters .\\n. .\\n\\n. . . and everything in the room goes blue.\\n\\n85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT\\nThe SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to\\ntear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind\\nthem.\\n\\nJANEY\\nJon . . .\\n(shrieking)\\nJON!!!\\n\\n86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\\nJON\\'s back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of\\nunbelievable agony.\\n\\nA moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a\\nphotographic negative -- stands in his place.\\n\\nThen the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The\\niridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to\\npieces.\\n\\nAnd then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim,\\nand we\\'re looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of\\nthe SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY,\\nwho gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.\\n\\nDISSOLVE TO:\\n\\n87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT\\nThe desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall\\nbehind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago\\nat 11:48 PM.\\n\\nFor a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches\\nthe rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the\\ndoor of the canteen.\\n\\n88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\\nDR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.\\n\\n89. INT. MEN\\'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\\nTWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into\\nthe mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous\\nthing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal\\ncord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous\\nsystem.\\n\\nThey pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in\\na haze of shimmering blue light.\\n\\n90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\\nDR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.\\n\\n91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\\nHORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A\\npartially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS\\nfor several seconds before vanishing altogether.\\n\\n92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\\nDR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.\\n\\n93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\\nDinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.\\n\\nJANEY\\nI can\\'t help it.  I\\'m going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it\\nfeels haunted.\\n\\nWALLY\\nIt\\'ll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that\\'s all.\\n(tugging at his ear)\\nDo you hear some kind of -- whistling?\\n\\nIndeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine.\\nOdder yet, WALLY\\'s hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY\\'s.\\nEveryone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish\\nphenomenon.\\n\\nUTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without\\nwarning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW\\nsuffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .\\n\\n. . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them,\\nnude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and\\nutensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.\\n\\nJANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go\\nto her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.\\n\\nJANEY\\nJON-N-N-N!!!\\n\\nDISSOLVE TO:\\n\\n94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\\nTHE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns,\\nstares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and\\nbegins to dig.\\n\\nA couple of inches down, he finds what he\\'s looking for: an ancient,\\ntattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and\\nJaney Slater.  She\\'s holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new\\nengagement ring.\\n\\nHis fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.\\n\\n95. SERIES OF SHOTS\\nQuick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:\\n\\n-- JON\\'s black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;\\n\\n-- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue\\nlight;\\n\\n-- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper.\\nThere\\'s a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a\\nterrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .\\n\\n-- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom\\ncloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.\\n\\n96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN\\nFists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in\\nthe ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at\\nfirst, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue\\nstarburst a mile above the ground.\\n\\n97. EXT. OUTER SPACE\\nAll at once, we\\'re back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth\\nat unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on\\ntoward Mars.\\n\\nThe red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame\\nas we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface.\\nIndividual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct:\\nvast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri.\\nHerschel\\'s famous canali.  And finally, the argyre\\nplanitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling\\ntwo jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular\\nridge.\\n\\nTwo eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a\\nhappy-face.\\n\\nMany miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian\\natmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n98. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN\\nThe late news, with highlights of DR. MANHATTAN\\'s press conference.\\nAs the throng of REPORTERS shove microphones at him, we ZOOM IN on\\nhis angered face:\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI said leave me alone!!\\n\\nThen there\\'s a sudden CUT.  We see the same REPORTERS, in the same\\npositions, only DR. MANHATTAN is gone -- and they\\'re all standing on\\nthe White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.\\n\\nPULL BACK TO:\\n\\n99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT\\nA restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair.\\nShe\\'s in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the\\nbig metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy\\nfurnished studio.\\n\\nTV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)\\n-- in Washington, where an irate Dr. Manhattan teleported\\na crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania\\nAvenue!\\n\\nTV ANCHORMAN (O.S.)\\nWell, Katie, I know some politicians who\\'d like to learn that trick --\\n\\nLAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.

A\\nDRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight\\nWOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and\\noff as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging\\ntipsy giggles.\\n\\n102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT\\nA three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.  A door opens, and the MAN\\nushers his date inside with exaggerated formality.  Her name is LUCY;\\nhis is Edgar William Jacobi, but -- for reasons soon to be revealed --\\nwe\\'ll call him MOLOCH.\\n\\nMOLOCH\\nNow.  What was milady drinking?\\n\\nLUCY\\nGin.  Straight up --\\n(mock-ladylike)\\n\\n-- with a little twist of lime.\\n\\nShe laughs convulsively, as if she\\'s just told the world\\'s funniest\\njoke.  MOLOCH lifts a single finger and starts toward the kitchen:\\n\\nMOLOCH\\nI think I can oblige.\\n\\n103. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\\nMOLOCH FREEZES in the doorway, his face taut with apprehension.  The\\ncontents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen\\nfloor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It\\'s a\\ndisaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in\\nthe doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.\\n\\nLUCY\\nJeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?\\n\\nOn cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH.\\nHe grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen\\ntable.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nMoloch.

I --\\n\\nRORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH\\'s chin and pulls him\\nclose.  Then, for LUCY\\'s benefit, he explains:\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nTurned state\\'s witness in \\'75.  Earned himself a brand-new face.\\n(twisting MOLOCH\\'s head to one side, for a better look)\\nHnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.\\n\\nHe shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There\\'s a sugar\\nbowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as\\nMOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.\\n\\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\\nComedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who\\'s\\nbehind it?\\n\\nMOLOCH\\nRorschach, you\\'re talkin\\' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with\\n--\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nWorked both sides of the fence.

I\\'ll be back.\\n\\nLUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH\\'s side and grips his arm as\\nRORSCHACH opens a rear window.  He\\'s climbing through the frame when\\nhe stops suddenly and points a finger at the frightened pair:\\n\\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\\nWord of advice for the lady . . . stock up on penicillin.\\n\\n-- and he\\'s out on the fire escape and GONE.  LUCY looks suspiciously\\nat MOLOCH, who shrugs, embarrassed: I don\\'t know what he\\'s talking\\nabout.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n104. INT. PENTAGON - WAR ROOM - DAY\\nThe familiar set from Dr. Strangelove: top brass seated at a\\nbig round table, with a huge Mercator-projection map of the world\\nlooming in BG.  The Afghan-Pakistani border is highlighted in red; a\\nMILITARY ANALYST paces in front of the big board with a penlight\\nPOINTER,\\nhighlighting areas of strategic importance.\\n\\nANALYST\\nOur projections show Pakistan falling within the week.

Of course.\\n\\nBy now, both coasts are pretty well blotted out.  The ANALYST, a\\ndedicated optimist, turns to announce:\\n\\nANALYST\\nAs you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the\\nfarm belt.\\n\\nPRESIDENT\\nWhat about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . \"nuclear winter\"\\ntheory?\\n\\nANALYST\\nWe don\\'t really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . .\\nmay depend on a quirk of the weather.\\n\\nPRESIDENT\\nThe weather.  I see.\\n(pause)\\nKeep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum\\nstrike conditions.\\n\\nThe SECRETARY OF STATE -- our old pal G.

Dr. Manhattan\\nmay decide to return.\\n\\nWith a heavy heart, the Chief Executive pushes himself away from the\\ntable -- and we get our first good look at him.  His face is lined\\nand tired, his hair is flecked with white, but he\\'s none other than\\nthat beloved statesman RICHARD M. NIXON -- still vital and robust at\\n74.\\n\\nPRESIDENT (cont.)\\nGood God.  At times like this I wish I\\'d never come out of\\nretirement.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n105. INT. DOCTOR\\'S OFFICE - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY\\nA private practice in midtown Manhattan.  LAURIE emerges from an\\nexamination room, grim and hollow-eyed; the DOCTOR hangs back in the\\ndoorway.\\n\\nDOCTOR\\nI\\'m sorry, Miss Juspecyzk.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nNot at all, Doctor.  I appreciate your honesty.\\n\\n106. INT. GUNGA DINER - DUSK\\nA greasy Indian restaurant in a Village storefront.  In a booth near\\nthe entrance we find LAURIE and DREIBERG munching on chicken\\ntandoori.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nChrist yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a\\ncouple of rough nights, I\\'ll tell you . . .\\n(pause)\\nHow about you, Laurie?\\n\\nLAURIE\\n(lying -- with forced cheer)\\nOh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the\\nhell out.\\n(shrugging)\\nNo expense account.  No place to live.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nYou\\'ll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each\\nother, someone might put two and two together . . .\\n\\nLAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThey\\'re not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon\\'s gone, we\\'re\\nright on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the\\nWatchmen.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nMaybe not, but why take chances?\\n\\nLAURIE\\nDan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I\\'ve spent\\nall these years keeping Jon together, and now that it\\'s over I feel --\\nI feel glad.  I\\'m finally free to, to go out and live my own\\nlife, and --\\n\\n-- and she\\'s dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a\\ndamper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts\\nto get up.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nI\\'m just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I\\'d better go find\\nmyself a cheap room.\\n\\nDREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the\\ndoor of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and\\nchases her down:\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nLaurie, wait.  I\\'ve got a spare room.  It\\'s empty.  If you\\'d like . .\\n.\\nLAURIE\\nOh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn\\'t.  You\\'d just be all nervous about --\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nNo, screw that.  What you were saying before, it\\'s absolutely\\nright.  -- I\\'d love to have you stay.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nYou\\'re sure?\\n\\nHe nods.  She smiles and takes his arm as they walk out of the\\nrestaurant.\\n\\nTHROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the\\nstreet outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of\\nframe, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of\\nketchup.\\n\\nHe inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down\\nquestion mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he\\nopens it again, he\\'s got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.\\n\\n107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET\\nA SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant,\\nthen disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls\\ncasually down the alleyway.\\n\\nHe moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the\\ncrumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a\\nsmall recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a\\nshifting INKBLOT MASK.\\n\\n108. INT. DREIBERG\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\\nThe guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style:\\nflowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc.\\nIt\\'s small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative \"aah\" as\\nDREIBERG ushers her in.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThis is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\'s lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands\\nthere for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.\\n\\nLAURIE (cont.)\\nAre you . . . waiting for a tip?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nOh.  No.  Sorry.  I\\'ll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I\\nmean, if you need some aspirin, or --\\n\\nLAURIE\\nI\\'m gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You\\'ve been really\\nsweet.  Sleep tight, okay?\\n\\nShe gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek, then returns to her\\nunpacking.  DREIBERG watches her for a second, then turns to go.\\n\\n109. INT. HALLWAY - ON DREIBERG\\nAs he closes the door, he get a quick glimpse, from behind, of LAURIE\\nunbuttoning her shirt.  He quickly averts his gaze and pulls the door\\nshut.\\n\\n110. INT. DREIBERG\\'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\\nDREIBERG, in pajamas, climbs into bed and kills the light.  He folds\\nhis hands behind his head and stares up at the ceiling.\\n\\n111. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE\\nAnother quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it\\'s SILK SPECTRE --\\nLAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off\\nvaliantly, but she\\'s heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.\\n\\nAn oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into\\nframe; he\\'s clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP\\noverhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE\\'s path and\\nsnatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.\\n\\n112. INT. BEDROOM - ON DREIBERG.\\nHis head turns at the sound of WATER running in the bathroom\\nadjacent.  He\\'s going to be awake half the night thinking of\\nLAURIE.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n113. EXT. STREET - DAY\\nEarly morning.  Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in\\nan alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and\\ncrewcut.  He\\'s got a definite CTU look about him.\\n\\nMOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA\\nDINER.\\n\\n114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\\nA twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and\\npulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the\\nnose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges\\nof his EYELIDS.\\n\\nHis eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper;\\nbizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it\\nup . . .\\n\\nThere\\'s a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.\\n\\nA low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and\\nsees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.\\n\\nHe GASPS and lunges for the door.  RORSCHACH\\'s arm snakes out and\\nholds the stall door shut.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nTwo things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational\\ndrugs.\\n\\nMOLOCH\\nNo, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got\\nsomething for you.\\n\\nA long pause.  RORSCHACH GROWLS again: let\\'s have it.\\n\\nMOLOCH (cont.)\\nThere\\'s a big bunch of research scientists -- missing.  Blake was on\\na case, trying to track \\'em down.\\n(beat)\\nIt\\'s big, Rorschach.  Something to do with Doc Manhattan.  That\\'s all\\nI\\'ve been able to find out.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nDrug habit.  Highly illegal.  Hnrrh.\\n(snarling)\\nLet it go time.  In future -- just say no.\\n\\nWith that he disappears over the edge of the stall.  MOLOCH sits\\nthere a moment.  He reaches for the stall door, rattles it.  It won\\'t\\nopen.\\n\\nMOLOCH\\nHEY!!\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\'s stuck a broomstick through the door handles on the\\nadjacent stalls. As MOLOCH POUNDS on the door in frustration, we\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n115. INT. VEIDT\\'S PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY\\nA plush RECEPTION ROOM in his Veidt Industries pyramid; it\\'s\\ndecorated in the same Egyptian motifs as his office.  VEIDT sits in\\nan overstuffed chair, surrounded by VIDEO CAMERAS; he\\'s in the\\nprocess of charming JUSTINE JAMES, a fawning Barbara Walters-figure\\nwho\\'s prepping a segment for her next celebrity-chat special.\\n\\nJUSTINE\\nNow Adrian, I guess there\\'s one thing everyone wants to know.\\nAre you the world\\'s smartest man?\\n\\nVEIDT\\nOh my, yes.

The CAMERA CREW\\'s getting\\ncurious.  VEIDT gets up from his chair.\\n\\nVEIDT (cont.)\\nExcuse me a second.\\n\\nHe goes to the office door and slips inside.

VEIDT\\'S OFFICE - DAY\\nVEIDT is shocked to find RORSCHACH down on the carpet, wrestling with\\nhis mutant LYNX.  He CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE:\\n\\nVEIDT\\nKITTY!!\\n\\nOne last nip, and the cat backs off.  RORSCHACH gets to his feet --\\nno visible signs of damage, except for a severe bruise to his\\ndignity.\\n\\nVEIDT (cont.)\\nHow the hell did you get in here?\\n\\nThe curtains are flapping; a BREEZE hits VEIDT across the face.

Immediately.\\n(smiling)\\nI swear, you are acting like a kid on a date.\\n\\nSucking on his burnt fingers, he reluctantly takes the wineglass.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nOkay, I\\'m nervous.

With a smile\\nshe reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt\\npocket.\\n\\nDreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making\\nhim nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her\\nhands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so\\nthat he can\\'t avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on\\nhis mouth.\\n\\nThe PIANO INTRO ends, and Fats\\' teasing vocal begins:\\n\\n\"S\\'posin\\' I should fall in love with you . . .\\nDo you think that you could love me too . . .\"\\n\\n125. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)\\nSONG CONTINUES UNDERNEATH, cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a\\nhorrific silent movie.  RORSCHACH races out of the bathroom carrying\\na plastic MOP BUCKET, plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans --\\nordinary household supplies.  He enters the kitchen, rummages around\\nunder the sink, finds another handful of bottles: cleaning fluid,\\nrubbing alcohol, Drano.\\n\\nAlmost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove, turns on all the\\nburners -- and BLOWS OUT THE FLAMES.\\n\\n\"S\\'posin\\' I should hug you and caress you . . .\\nWould it impress you . . .\"\\n\\n126.

There\\'s a pile of bottles -- only half-emptied --\\nresting next to the front door.  The CTU COPS are pounding on the\\nfront door, trying to break it down.  RORSCHACH crouches in the\\nhallway just outside the living room.\\n\\nThe door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH\\nstrikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN --\\ncreating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the\\npuddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF\\nBOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.\\n\\n\"S\\'posin\\' I should say for you I yearn . . .\\n(Yeah I yearn.

STAIRWELL LANDING - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)\\nRORSCHACH opens a bottle of CLEANING FLUID, stuffs a wad of newspaper\\ninto its neck.  The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from\\nthe smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov\\ncocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.\\n\\nThe COPS pitch backward as the bottle blows up.

Two flights down, a pair of CTU\\nCOPS are fighting their way through the inferno, still on his tail.\\n\\nHe still has his mop bucket; it\\'s half-full of water.

DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\\nA DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file,\\nflicks on a flashlight.\\n\\nMannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The\\nlight shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders\\nover.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and\\non the floor, a ROPE.\\n\\nThere\\'s a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it,\\nsticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a\\ncharred scrap of FABRIC from a child\\'s pajamas, decorated with\\nballoons and teddy bears.\\n\\nHe stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden\\nCHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding\\nparaphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher\\'s\\nknives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh\\nWINDOW.\\n\\nRORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)\\nDogs wouldn\\'t shut up.  That\\'s when I knew where the little girl had\\ngone.\\n\\n149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\\nThe German shepherds romp in the dying light.  We CLOSE IN ON the\\ndogs until we see what it is they\\'re tussling over: A BIG BLOODY KNOB\\nOF BONE.\\n\\nRORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)\\nDecided to wait for the owner . . .\\n\\n150. INT. FACTORY - ENTRY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)\\nKeys in the lock.  A moment later, the door swings wide;  a FAT MAN\\nenters and whistles to the dogs.\\n\\nFAT MAN\\nFred?  Barney?  Dinnerti--\\n\\nRORSCHACH steps out of the shadows and BASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD.\\n\\n151. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\\nRORSCHACH, master of suspense, decides to take a break in the\\nstory.  He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his\\nreply, asks:\\n\\nDR. LONG\\nThen what happened?\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\n. . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had\\nto break in.\\n\\n152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)\\nThe FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He\\'s\\nhandcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a\\nGROCERY SACK.\\n\\nHe kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off\\nhis glove and reaches into the sack.\\n\\nFAT MAN\\nWhat -- what are you d--\\n\\nRORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER\\ninto his open mouth.  He\\'s got several pounds of the stuff, and he\\nspends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN\\'s face,\\nthroat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he\\'s\\ndone, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER\\nBLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN\\'s head.\\n\\nFRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door,\\nand -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs\\ninside.\\n\\nThen he stands back and enjoys the carnage.\\n\\n153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\\nDR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things\\nup.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nWhen they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their\\nskulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies.\\n(leaning forward)\\nSee, God didn\\'t kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed\\nher . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did,\\nhe did\\'t seem to mind.\\n\\nDR. LONG\\nThat man, then, he was the first.  The first you --\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nSaw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn\\'t make\\nit that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.\\n(slight smile)\\nWhat else can I illuminate?\\n\\nLONG\\'s had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the\\nPRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he\\npoints a finger at LONG\\'s inkblot.\\n\\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\\nNo right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . .\\njust a man\\'s face.\\n(pause)\\nSee it now?\\n\\nThe GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a\\ncouple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a\\nsecond he reaches for his briefcase; as he\\'s gathering his cards, he\\nSTOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern\\non top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.\\n\\nLONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the\\nRorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.\\n\\nDISSOLVE TO:\\n\\n154. EXT. BARN - TOWARD DUSK\\nA rural tree-lined area outside the city.  A COMPACT BUBBLE-CAR pulls\\nup outside a big ramshackle barn and stops; DREIBERG gets out, goes to\\nthe padlocked doors, fumbles in his pocket for a key.\\n\\nAfter a moment, LAURIE wanders up beside him.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nEnough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nMemory lane.\\n\\nHe opens the padlock, ushers LAURIE inside.\\n\\n155. INT. BARN - A MOMENT LATER\\nInside the barn is a HUGE OBLONG SHAPE covered with a TARPAULIN.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nDaniel . . .\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nGimme a hand with the tarp, would you?  You take that side.\\n\\nShe goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull\\nit back to reveal . . .\\n\\nTHE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL\\'s high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It\\'s a bit\\ntarnished from years of disuse, but it\\'s still an impressive sight.\\nDREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around\\nto join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThe Owlship.  I can\\'t believe it.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\n-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.\\n\\n156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\\nThe two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on\\nthe electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin,\\nreliving days gone by.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nI took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some\\ncows.  -- I wonder if she\\'d make it down to Antarctica.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nAntarctica??\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nAdrian\\'s headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come\\nalong.\\n(pause)\\nI\\'ve been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn\\'t be a\\nbad place to sit out a war.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWould you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be\\nleft.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nYou and me.\\n\\nHe looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her\\ngaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the\\ncabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly\\nrejected.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\n. . . Yeah, you\\'re right.  Probably wouldn\\'t make it down there\\nanyway.\\n\\nBehind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She\\'s just\\nopened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES\\n-- their old superhero togs.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nDan!  The spare costumes!  I can\\'t believe you kept them.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nMe neither.  Mine barely even fits.\\n(chuckling)\\nThe thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can\\'t.  Helping\\npeople, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don\\'t\\nknow.  It all seems so abstract.\\n\\nLAURIE\\'s holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing\\nherself in a small mirror above a sink.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nGod, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nWhat are you up to?\\n\\nLAURIE\\nDon\\'t look.  Turn around.\\n\\nSmirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the\\ncabin.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nThis\\'d better not be what I think it is.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nOkay!\\n\\nDREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE\\'s in full costume, looking quite\\nimposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns\\nshock:\\n\\nDREIBERG (cont.)\\nMy God, it\\'s the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender\\nof the weak!\\n\\nLAURIE\\nIn the flesh.\\n\\nShe ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind,\\nand strokes his thinning hair.\\n\\nLAURIE (cont.)\\nPoor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don\\'t you.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nSaving the world?  I guess I do.\\n(smiling)\\nMaybe we can still save ourselves . . .\\n\\nDISSOLVE TO:\\n\\n157. EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - DUSK\\nA massive PEACE RALLY downtown.  Thousands of citizens have turned\\nout; PLACARDS and PROTEST SIGNS are everywhere.  Each remark is met\\nby CHEERS and CHANTS, by raucous\\nBOOS as well . . . and while the crowd is split between pacifists and\\nhawks, they\\'re all frightened as hell.\\n\\nThings are much the same in London, Berlin -- possibly even Moscow.\\nThe end is nigh, and passions flare.  It\\'s anarchy waiting to\\nhappen.\\n\\nMAN ON STAGE\\nYou know what the Joint Chiefs of Staff are doing right now?  They\\'re\\nsitting in the Pentagon talking about a first strike.  That\\'s right --\\na first strike!\\n\\nVOICE IN CROWD\\nYou think the reds ain\\'t doing the same thing?\\n\\nMAN ON STAGE\\nThen for the love of God let\\'s negotiate.  We can start a war.  But\\nwe can\\'t stop it!!\\n\\nVOICE IN CROWD II\\nIt\\'s pinko simps like you that drove Dr. Manhattan to Mars!\\n\\nVOICE IN CROWD III\\nDr. Manhattan was an inhuman fascist!\\n\\nVOICE IN CROWD IV\\nIt\\'s God\\'s judgment!  Jesus is the way!\\n\\nA HECKLER fights his way onstage and lunges for the microphone:\\n\\nHECKLER\\nRussia\\'s just been waiting for an opening.  They won\\'t show us\\nno mercy.  I say NUKE \\'EM NOW!!\\n\\nMAN ON STAGE\\nYou think this is some kind of grudge match??  We\\'re talking the\\nend of the world!!\\n\\nThe two of them grapple at the mike, and the HECKLER falls off the\\nstage.  On cue, the crowd ERUPTS.  FIGHTS break out; COPS start\\nswinging rifle butts.\\n\\nAs PRO-NUKERS swarm the stage, our gaze turns upward.  A trio of\\nHOVERCRAFT hangs in the air above the seaport.  Their undersides --\\noutfitted with heavy artillery on turrets -- bear the initials\\n\"CTU\"\\n\\n158. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK\\nCTU MEN watch the nascent riot through a plexiglass canopy.\\n\\nCTU CAPTAIN\\nI\\'ve had it with these a-holes.  Drop the gas.\\n\\n159. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK\\nPANIC amongs the crowds as TEAR GAS CANISTERS explode in their\\nmidst.  The CTU ships descend ever closer to the ground.\\n\\nLOUDSPEAKER\\nCEASE AND DESIST AT ONCE.  WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO USE FORCE.\\n\\nA couple of COPS go down in the melee.  RIOTERS grab their rifles,\\nturn them on the CTU ships overhead.  OTHERS in the crowd fling\\nrocks, brickbats -- whatever\\'s handy.  HYSTERIA RULES.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n160. INT. BARN - DUSK\\nDREIBERG walks around to the front of the Owlship with a TOOLKIT,\\nwiping his hands on an oily rag.  He calls inside to LAURIE:\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nGuess that ought to do it.  Let\\'s shut her down --  Laurie?\\n\\nNo reply.  Curious, he climbs aboard.\\n\\n161. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\\nLAURIE\\'s standing by the monitor over the instrument console.  Her\\nface is distraught, agonized.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nDaniel, you ought to take a look at this.\\n\\nOnscreen, it\\'s total screaming chaos.  CANNONS on the bellies of the\\nCTU HOVERCRAFT swivel randomly, spitting AUTOMATIC FIRE at the mobs\\nbelow.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nWhat the hell -- ?\\n\\nLAURIE\\nIt\\'s a peace rally.  The CTU\\'s just opened fire on the crowd.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nOh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.\\n\\nHe turns away, paralyzed with horror.  LAURIE watches awestruck.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThey\\'re just mowing \\'em down.\\n(pause)\\nThis is it.  The end of the world.  This is what it looks like.\\n\\nCAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on DREIBERG\\'s stricken face as we\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n162. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE>\\nWe\\'re back in slo-mo sepia land, the Golden Age of Superheroes.  THE\\nOWLSHIP emerges from a fogbank and rises majestically into frame,\\nlike the Seventh Cavalry arriving to save the day.  As it draws\\ncloser, the perspex canopy coming into view, we can just make out\\nNIGHT OWL at the helm, with SILK SPECTRE riding shotgun.\\n\\nThere\\'s a FRENZIED MOB below, racing right and left, their aimless\\nmotions stylized and surreal.  They\\'re beset by a sudden WINDSTORM as\\nthe Owlship\\'s powerful BLOWERS clear the TEAR GAS from this fantasy\\nequivalent of the seaport plaza.  Faces turn skyward; fingers point --\\n\\n-- and suddenly, the footage we\\'re watching undergoes a SUBTLE\\nTRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the\\naction QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we\\'re in\\nfull-color and real-time --\\n\\n163. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\\n-- because the Owlship is really there . . . and by God, the\\nWatchmen are back in action a quarter-mile above the South St.\\nSeaport!\\n\\n164. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\\nThe three CTU SHIPS are now visible through the cockpit dome.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nOkay Laurie, let\\'s see if we\\'ve still got what it takes.\\n\\nOn the panel, a COMPUTER TARGETING DEVICE homes in on a CTU SHIP.\\n\\n165. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT\\nA RADAR MAN stares at his console in puzzlement.\\n\\nCTU RADAR MAN\\nSir, we\\'ve got an odd blip off starboard . . .\\n\\nThe ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY as a sudden EXPLOSION --\\n\\n166. AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT\\n-- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured\\nship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets\\nsputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against\\nthe water.\\n\\n167. ANGLE ON CROWD\\npointing at the skies in disbelief.\\n\\nVOICE IN CROWD\\nLOOK!  UP THERE!\\n\\nVOICE IN CROWD II\\nOh my God, it\\'s --\\n\\n\\n168. INT. OWLSHIP - ON DREIBERG\\nHe barks into a microphone:\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nAttention CTU!  Cease fire immediately --\\n\\n169. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK\\nGround level.  From the midst of the bewildered CROWD we watch as the\\nOWLSHIP and the CTU talk some serious trash:\\n\\nOWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER\\n-- or we\\'ll BLOW YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE SKY!\\n\\nCTU LOUDSPEAKER\\nUNREGISTERED CRAFT.  IDENTIFY YOURSELF.\\n\\nOWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER\\nBABY . . . WE\\'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.\\n\\nThe crowd\\'s in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But\\na dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the\\nstrange sight overhead.\\n\\nVOICE IN CROWD\\n. . . IT\\'S THE WATCHMEN!!\\n\\nEXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air,\\nclumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging\\nimmobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West\\nshowdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate\\ninto position.\\n\\n170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\\nDREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nWe\\'re gonna have to shave this one close.\\n\\nAn instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle\\nFULL-FORWARD.\\n\\n171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\\nWith a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS\\nCONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond\\nbefore -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES\\nFORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD\\nCHEERS.\\n\\n172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\\nDREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the\\naft view from the ship.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThey\\'re following us.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nAll right.  Mission accomplished.\\n\\nHe\\'s no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the\\nship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.\\n\\n173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT\\nThe OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU\\nSHIPS rip past on either side.\\n\\n174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT\\nASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The\\nOWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE\\nblows a HOLE in its facade.\\n\\n175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\\nfiring TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.\\n\\n176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\\nDREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar\\nreadout:\\n\\nLAURIE\\nMissed \\'em Dan.  You\\'re aiming high!\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nI don\\'t want to take \\'em out.  Just want to keep \\'em interested.\\n\\nLAURIE\\n(checking the monitor)\\nThey\\'re practically on us . . .\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nThat Detroit shit?  I\\'m so worried.\\n\\nHe punches a button on the dash.  It\\'s labelled \"TURBO.\"\\n\\n177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP\\nThe turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving\\nthe CTU craft in the dust.\\n\\n178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT\\nA line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly,\\nand -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.\\n\\nA moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The\\nless-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and\\nEXPLODES\\n\\nThe SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last\\nmoment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP\\nITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles\\nfor the airborne route.\\n\\n179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER\\nThe OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the\\ncars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.\\n\\nThere\\'s an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges\\nUP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS\\nagainst the roof of the tunnel.\\n\\n180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\\nThe end of the tunnel is coming up fast.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nFog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.\\n\\n181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT\\nThe OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an\\nalmost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its\\nwake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives --\\nbut, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward\\non a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the\\nwater.\\n\\n182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\\nThey\\'re in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of\\nintense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWe lost him.\\n\\nHe flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she\\nshakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.\\n\\nLAURIE (cont.)\\nOh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.\\n\\nFADE THROUGH TO:\\n\\n183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT\\nThe usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving\\nline.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall\\nand falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of\\nhim.\\n\\nTRUSTY\\nJust left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.\\n\\nThe CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes\\nthrough the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds,\\nit\\'s reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named\\nT-BONE.\\n\\nCON IN LINE\\nOtis went down.\\n\\nT-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of\\nSIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the\\nbiggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET:\\nLITTLE BIGGER.\\n\\nT-BONE\\nJust heard, boss.  Otis bought it.\\n\\nLITTLE BIGGER\\nFuckin\\' Rorschach.\\n(nodding to himself)\\nThis joint goes up.  Tonight.\\n\\n184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT\\nDrifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship\\nemerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale\\nblue moonlight.\\n\\n185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\\nThrough the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then\\ndisappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We\\'re taking a dreamy tour\\nof the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is\\nsinging \"You\\'re My Thrill.\"\\n\\nInstruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one\\'s at the\\ncontrols.\\n\\nThe ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the\\nwidth of the cabin floor.  A woman\\'s hand reaches for it, sets it\\nright.\\n\\nIt\\'s LAURIE, who\\'s midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG.\\nThe pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the\\ncabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nBetter.  Much better.\\n\\nDREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile\\ninstead.\\n\\nLAURIE (cont.)\\nI bet I know what made the difference this time.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nWhat?\\n\\nLAURIE\\n(smirking)\\nThe costumes.  Am I right?\\n\\nDREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite\\nhimself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.\\n\\nLAURIE (cont.)\\nCome on.  Admit it!\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nNo way.  I\\'m not that much of a pervert.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nYes you are.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\n(drily)\\nNo offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.\\n(pause; then, seriously)\\nTonight was the first time I\\'ve felt like myself in ten years.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThat\\'s because --\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nIt\\'s because there\\'s nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world\\'s\\nabout to end.\\n(a weird smile)\\nI feel like I could save it.\\n\\nHe grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to\\nthe instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship\\nhard right.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nYou\\'re full of yourself.  What are you doing?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nLong as we\\'re on the subject of perverts . . .\\n(turning to face her)\\nI miss Rorschach.  Let\\'s spring him.\\n\\nLAURIE\\n. . . What??\\n\\nDREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches\\nfor the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.\\n\\n186. EXT.

SIRENS HOWL\\nas we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild:\\ndisabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons,\\nthrowing food.\\n\\n188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\\nDREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG\\'s eyes are\\nriveted to a monitor over the controls:\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nI think we\\'re just a trifle late.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nJesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .\\n\\nThe MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below\\nthem.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire\\nwith the guards in the watchtower.  It\\'s an ugly, bloody mess.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nI know he\\'s totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen\\ntimes.\\n\\n189. INT. CELL - NIGHT\\nSIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs\\ndrawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.\\n\\n190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT\\nSmoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past\\nsprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR\\nMENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It\\'s the\\npsychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE,\\nand T-BONE.\\n\\nWheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop\\noutside RORSCHACH\\'s cell and GRIN in anticipation.\\n\\nLITTLE BIGGER\\nFind an outlet for this thing\\n(shouting)\\nRorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It\\'s payback time!\\n\\nRAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying\\na big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH\\'s\\ndoor, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.\\n\\nCARLOS\\nSee this, runt?  We\\'re gonna take your puny little balls off . . .\\nand pickle \\'em!!\\n(chortling)\\nAww!  I think he just wet his pants!\\n\\nHILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place\\nat the panel in the door:\\n\\nT-BONE\\nLemme see.  Lemme see!\\n\\nLITTLE BIGGER\\nRelax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve.\\n(to T-BONE)\\nWhat\\'s he doin\\' now?\\n\\nNo response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed\\ntightly to the panel.\\n\\nLITTLE BIGGER (cont.)\\nYou deaf?  I said, what\\'s he --\\n\\nHe gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE\\'s legs buckle and he topples over\\nbackwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON\\nquivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye\\nsocket.\\n\\nRAFE\\nBOSS!  JESUS!\\n\\nLITTLE BIGGER\\nSon of a bitch! -- WE\\'RE COMING RORSCHACH.

RORSCHACH\\'S CELL - THAT MOMENT\\nThe LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH\\'S\\nFACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the\\nwall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his\\nTOILET.\\n\\nGrunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its\\nmounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is\\nFLOODED.\\n\\n195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER\\nRAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.\\n\\nRAFE\\nOkay, boss, that oughta do it.\\n\\nThey give the door a shove.

CELL - THAT MOMENT\\nIn answer to RAFE\\'s question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door.\\nHe SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO\\'s outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of\\nthe LOCK catches CARLO\\'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .\\n\\n. . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS,\\nmonkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide\\nand an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.\\n\\nCARLOS\\nYOU\\'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --\\n\\nFrom the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor\\nBETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --\\n\\n-- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --\\n\\n-- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do\\na herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --\\n\\n-- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock\\nDIM and DIE.\\n\\nLITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down\\noff his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies\\nof the dead.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nYour move . . . runt.\\n\\nThe midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor\\nas fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.\\n\\n197.

We should be close to solitary .\\n. .\\n\\nTheir heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND\\nCORRIDOR crosses the one they\\'re standing in.  As they watch, a\\nSCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.\\n\\nDREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a\\nfamiliar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\n. . . Rorschach??\\n\\nRORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second\\nand a half -- then keeps on walking.\\n\\n198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER\\nThe terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he\\'s just hit a dead end.  He\\nthrows a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him.\\nDesperate, he ducks into a MEN\\'S ROOM.\\n\\nRORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him,\\nLAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross\\ncorridor.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nRorschach!  Is that you??\\n\\nHe turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and\\ndispassionate, he enters the MEN\\'s room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand\\nat the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWhat\\'s he doing?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nI think he\\'s going to the john.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nMy God!

UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER\\nLots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling\\nabout.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.\\n\\nSECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and\\nwhat looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal\\nramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON\\'s in the passenger seat, and there\\'s an\\nimposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating\\na long stay.\\n\\nPRESIDENT NIXON\\nHello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?\\n\\nSECRETARY LIDDY\\nShe\\'s all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right\\naway.\\n\\nLIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless\\ncorridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.\\n\\nSECRETARY LIDDY (cont.)\\nWeatherman says we\\'re lookin\\' good.

Some gratitude.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWill you two lovebirds keep it down?\\n\\nStill grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at\\nthe monitor LAURIE\\'s watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the\\nscreen:\\n\\nNEWSCASTER\\n. . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was\\nunavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the\\nAntarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\n\"Ozone layer\"?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\n(rolling his eyes)\\nChrist.

A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous\\nstrip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered\\naround what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is\\none.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT\\'s Antarctic retreat.\\n\\n203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT\\nThe entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian\\nstyle as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad\\nfigure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered\\nLYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him.\\nOne of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a\\nsilver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back\\nof the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.\\n\\nLACKEY\\nWelcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nFeed Bubastis.  I\\'ll have dinner when I\\'ve looked in on the world.\\n\\nThey hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him\\nto:\\n\\n204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT\\nThe room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated\\nREMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair,\\nRED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.\\n\\nVEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal\\na towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid,\\npicking up transmissions from all over the world.  It\\'s far more\\ninformational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp,\\na hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in\\nand his eyes begin to rove.\\n\\n205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL\\nPANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials,\\nsitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled \"LONDON.\"\\nVEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER\\'S VOICE\\ncomes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense\\nlogo . . .\\n\\nBBC NEWSCASTER\\n-- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as\\npossible.

White House spokesmen\\ninsist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing\\nnegotiations --\\n\\nFLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the\\nbottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT\\'s antarctic\\nretreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new\\nangle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are\\nclear.  FLICK --\\n\\n-- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we\\'re\\nwatching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from\\ntwenty-some years ago; he\\'s sitting at a table in the Gila Flas\\ncanteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he\\'s getting ready to\\npropose.\\n\\n206.

For an awkward moment neither of them can\\nthink of anything to say.\\n\\nThen RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the \"case,\" breaks the\\nsilence.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nHnrrr -- changes everything.  Let\\'s get moving.\\n\\n209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\\nRORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he\\npries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily\\nat a RAT which scampers out of the hole.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\\nA distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP.\\nRORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of\\nsatisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees\\nDREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.\\n\\nAbove their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.\\n\\n212. INT.

MANHATTAN\\nIt will happen, Laurie.  I\\'ve already seen it.  Neither of us\\ncan do anything to change it.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\'s frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside\\nthe cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR.\\nMANHATTAN\\'s hand.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nLAURIE!  DON\\'T --\\n\\nHands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and\\nLAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.\\n\\nStunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There\\'s obviously nothing he can\\ndo.

She takes a couple of halting steps,\\nthen GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red\\nsands.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\'s gone several paces before he realizes there\\'s a\\nproblem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at\\nthe air, trying and failing to draw a breath.

Then she\\nstops in her tracks.\\n\\nBefore her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN\\'s new abode: a\\nPALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren\\nsands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS,\\nsurrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and\\npendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering\\ncrystalline castle.\\n\\nDR.

MARS - DR. MANHATTAN\\'S PALACE - NIGHT\\nLAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals\\naround the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the\\nenormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING\\n-- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThis whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nYes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you\\'ll tell me\\nyou\\'re sleeping with Dreiberg.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nYou -- you know about me and Dan?\\n\\nHe gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.\\n\\nDR.

MANHATTAN\\nI\\'ll be here for the next year or so.  Then I\\'m going to work my way\\nout toward the edge of the universe.\\n(staring out at the landscape)\\nUtterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn\\'t it beautiful?\\n\\nShe moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and\\nfissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and\\nfrightened.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nJon -- there\\'s something I have to know.  Did you love me\\nonce?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nYes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nYet you must\\'ve known all along that you\\'d give me cancer.  Just be\\nbeing with me.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI didn\\'t give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don\\'t\\nknow what did.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nBut you knew that I\\'d -- die.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nMemories of the future are just like any others.  I\\'ve tried not to\\ndwell on the unpleasant ones . . .\\n(pause)\\nYou won\\'t die of cancer, Laurie.  There won\\'t be time for that.\\n\\nLAURIE\\'s blood runs cold as she realizes what he\\'s telling her.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThen it\\'s going to happen.  The world\\'s going to end.  -- And you\\'ve\\nalways known.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\n(nodding)\\nAlways.  Ever since the day I died.\\n\\nHe walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the\\nforbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in\\nher hands.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\\nDo you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it\\'s been like for me\\nthese last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be\\ndestroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless\\nagent of its destruction?\\n\\nLAURIE\\n(sobbing)\\nThen why don\\'t you . . . do something about it!\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nBecause --\\n\\nLAURIE\\nBecause you can\\'t, I know, it\\'s preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.\\n(angrily)\\nJon.  This, this \"script\" you\\'re following . . . who writes it?\\n\\nDR.

Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled ³MOSCOW² and ³WASHINGTON, D.C.² -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.\\n\\nA second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.

The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.\\n\\nA HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They¹re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.\\n\\n223. INT.

At his side, the MUTANT LYNX\\ngrowls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal\\'s\\nneck: quiet, girl.\\n\\nRORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN\\nFLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening\\nscene.  Suddenly . . .\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nVEIDT!\\n\\nVEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall;\\nit catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG\\nbacks against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward\\nhim, TEETH BARED.\\n\\nVEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a\\nfuturistic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along --\\npart of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nAdrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn\\'t you let us in?\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nHe\\'s the one.  He\\'s been the one all along.  Stalking us.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nAdrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --\\n\\nVEIDT\\nYeah.  See, I\\'ve been working on a little project.  Top secret, of\\ncourse . . .\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nThe missing scientists.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nUh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked\\nat Gila Flats.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nGila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .\\n\\nVEIDT\\nDr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we\\'ll go save\\nthe world.\\n\\n228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\\nGun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak.\\nRORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping\\nat his heels.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nBlake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers\\n-- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn\\'t Russia.\\n(tapping his chest)\\nIt was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill\\nhim.  The rest of it -- Rorschach\\'s capture, my \"assassination\" --\\nthat was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting\\nrid of Dr. Manhattan.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nWhat??\\n\\nVEIDT\\nI couldn\\'t let him interfere with my project.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nVeidt.  You\\'re the one who started World War III.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nNo.  I just hastened the inevitable.\\n(smiling)\\nHe\\'s been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a\\nlittle push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates\\ncancer.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nLaurie?  You\\'re responsible for --\\n\\nVEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls\\nout a smoke and strikes it against the box.\\n\\nVEIDT (cont.)\\nOne thing I\\'ve learned about cancer -- it\\'s much easier to generate\\nthan it is to cure.\\n\\nDREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the\\nstun gun across DREIBERG\\'s face, knocking him to the floor -- and\\nLEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nLet\\'s get something straight.  If you try that again, I\\'ll kill you\\nwithout a moment\\'s thought.\\n\\nThey\\'ve reached the entrance to VEIDT\\'s information room.  200\\nSCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them\\ninside.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nCall off the cat and I\\'ll kill you, Veidt.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nBefore you do that, you might want to look at what I\\'ve been looking\\nat.\\n\\n229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\\nVEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand\\ncorner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila\\nFlats, reassembling a WATCH.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nWhat is this?  It looks like Jon.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nIt is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr.\\nManhattan.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nGood Lord.  How\\'d you get it on tape?\\n\\nVEIDT\\nIt\\'s not on tape.  It\\'s live.  We\\'re watching it happen.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN\\'S PALACE - NIGHT\\nDR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him,\\nLAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she\\'s\\nhit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On\\nMars.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can\\'t die.  It\\'s a\\nmystery I\\'d like to penetrate.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nJon, I do not want to hear it.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI\\'m sorry.  Look -- there\\'s a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .\\n\\nLAURIE\\n(shaking her head)\\nOh God.  I\\'m no more than a bug on a windshield to you.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nYou\\'re the only human being I care for.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nThen do me a favor.  If the world\\'s going to end, it shouldn\\'t matter\\na bit.\\n(pause)\\nI want you to cure me.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI won\\'t do that.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nYou have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI explained this.  I can\\'t.  That\\'s not the way it happens.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nJon.  If you ever loved me -- if there\\'s anything human left in you\\n-- then do it.\\n\\nEyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her\\nchest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.\\n\\nHer fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR.\\nMANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he\\'s got to make the\\nhardest decision of his life.  And then . . .\\n\\nA BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN\\nINTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian\\nlandscape altogether.\\n\\nWith a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see\\nthe figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great\\nwhite VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the\\nMartian desert gradually materialize around them.\\n\\nThe two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like\\nstatues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what\\'s happened.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWhat -- am I --\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nCured, yes.\\n\\nUtterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a\\nhandrail for support.  He looks like a man who\\'s just had a heart\\nattack.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nJon, what is it?  What\\'s the matter?\\n\\nWhen he looks up at her, he\\'s DESOLATE -- his face filled with\\nDREAD.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nSomething. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It\\'s all gone blank on\\nme.  -- I can\\'t remember the future.\\n\\nSlowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around\\nhim.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nJon.  Let\\'s go back to Earth.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT\\nVEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F.\\nroom at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring\\nmachinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.\\n\\nInside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON\\nOSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY\\'s watch into\\nits brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching\\nhim from twenty-four years in the future.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nGentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.\\n(pause)\\nStand back from the field.  It\\'ll blow you to bits.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nWhat is it?  How does it work?\\n\\nVEIDT\\nIt\\'s a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow\\nbackward in time.\\n(smiling)\\nThere are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing\\nparallel to our own --\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nAdrian -- you\\'ve lost it.\\n\\nVEIDT\\n(pointing at the tachyon bubble)\\nI\\'ve seen them!  I\\'ve seen them in there.\\n(pause)\\n\\nIn some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it\\nsurvives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.\\n\\nHe draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.\\n\\nVEIDT (cont.)\\nThe creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war.\\n(wild-eyed)\\nDo you understand now?  Do you see what I¹m going to do?  I¹m going to change the past!\\n\\n232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT\\nDR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWe¹re too late.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nIt¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .\\n\\nLAURIE\\nJon -- what??\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nThe south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.\\n\\n233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\\nInside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY¹s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nAt first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.\\n\\nHe steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nIt ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds.\\n(turning to face them)\\nIn a minute I¹ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I¹ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman¹s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.\\n\\nDREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\n. . . And they call me a fucking nut.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nAdrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.\\n\\nVEIDT\\nDon¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nAnd what if you¹re wrong?\\n\\nVEIDT\\nI¹m not.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nWhat if you¹re wrong??\\n\\nVEIDT\\nThen I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!\\n(shouting)\\nI¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!\\n\\n234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\\nA POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nThat¹s it.  That¹s the source of the time disturbance.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nJon, where are we?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nVeidt¹s complex.\\n\\n235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\\n\\nTwenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler¹s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:\\n\\nVEIDT\\nYour problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years\\nchasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . .\\nas if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nYou ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist\\nbullshit is going to save the world?\\n\\nVEIDT\\nWe\\'d better hope so.  -- It\\'s almost time.\\n\\nHe kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum.\\nThen he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.\\n\\n236. VEIDT\\'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS\\nIn the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears\\na SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .\\n\\n237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\\nA LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon\\nbubble.  There\\'s a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up\\n--  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT\\'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the\\ntrigger . . .\\n\\n. . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.\\nVEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .\\n\\n. . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with\\nLAURIE at his side.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?\\n\\nVEIDT\\nJon!  Get back!  You don\\'t understand.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees\\nhimself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of\\nthe I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he\\'s\\nsurprised.\\n\\nIn the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to\\nsidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN\\nTHE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.\\n\\nVEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE\\'s directly in his path.  He\\nshoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and\\npoints his STUN GUN directly at her --\\n\\n-- and a millisecond later, he¹s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.\\n\\nVEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN¹s outstretched finger --\\n\\nVEIDT\\nNO!!!!\\n\\n-- and in the wink of an eye, he¹s VAPORIZED.  All that¹s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.\\n\\nDREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWhat was he doing?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nTrying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nHe was right.\\n\\nRORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nHe did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It¹s so elegant.  It¹s so obvious.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN¹s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nJon --\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nSpace and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nJon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nI see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!\\n\\nHe lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz\\naround his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the\\nroom dim; it\\'s as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the\\nworld into his own massive frame.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nMy work here is finished . . .\\n\\nThe others cower.  They sense that something large is about to\\nhappen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the\\ntest chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the\\ntiny\\nhole in time.\\n\\nHe does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS\\ninto a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND\\nSTEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.\\n\\n238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\\nJON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter\\nbewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling\\ngloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.\\n\\nDR. MANHATTAN\\nDon\\'t be afraid, Jon.  I\\'ll be here with you.\\n\\nA second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps\\nforward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.\\n\\nFor a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN\\'s frame\\nsurrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR.\\nMANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the\\nchamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across\\nthe shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he\\nspreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding\\nFLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging\\nwith nothingness . . .\\n\\n. . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue\\nlight dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he\\'s\\nalive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.\\n\\n239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER\\nThe timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of\\nhis awed colleagues, who\\'ve seen everything through the observation\\npanel.\\n\\nSCIENTIST\\nWhat in the name of God . . .\\n\\nThe SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY,\\nsobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As\\nshe clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he\\nlooks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .\\n\\nJON\\nYour watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --\\n\\nSCIENTIST II\\nLOOK!!\\n\\nThe SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber .\\n. . which isn\\'t there.  Instead, there\\'s a rippling, irregular\\nRUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are\\nthree odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and\\nRORSCHACH.\\n\\n240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT\\'S LAB - THE PRESENT\\nDREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the\\nastounded SCIENTISTS.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWhat happened -- ?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nHe saved himself.  He changed the past.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWhere did he go?\\n\\nBefore DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to\\nTHROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For\\na moment everything\\'s back to normal --\\n\\n-- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they\\'re in begins to\\nDISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.\\n\\nA sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around\\nthem, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge\\ninto . . .\\n\\n241. EXT. VORTEX EFFECT\\nDREIBERG, LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an\\notherdimensional funhouse of sound and color.  If space and time\\ncould be compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride, this\\nwould be it.  Their bodies contract and distend, warp and elongate;\\ntheir tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks; and then, before they\\nknow it, they find themselves deposited --\\n\\n242. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT\\n-- smack in the middle of a busy intersection.  The three of them\\nmaterialize from nowhere; a southbound VAN swerves to avoid them,\\nslamming into a row of parked cars, and a northbound TAXICAB does the\\nsame, knocking over a fire hydrant.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nDan, is this -- is this New York??\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nThose cars.  What year is this??\\n\\nLAURIE\\nEverything\\'s changed --\\n\\nIt\\'s a disorienting world they\\'ve landed in.  In fact, it\\'s\\nour world, our New York, and everything -- the cars,\\nthe clothing, the very look of the city -- seems just a trifle out of\\nwhack . . .\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nHnrrrrr -- we never happened.\\n\\nBYSTANDERS cluster about, laughing and taunting, highly amused by the\\nobvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst.  There are, of\\ncourse, no costumed heroes in our world, and their sudden\\npresence prompts a Babel of speculation among the onlookers:\\nNuts?  Fruits?  Out-of-work actors?\\n\\nRORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious, who gets a touch too\\nclose, and the mood begins to turn hostile.  The CROWD, now grown to\\nseveral dozen people, is threatening to block the intersection\\naltogether; a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a\\nshrill WHISTLE.\\n\\nDREIBERG\\nOh my God, they still ride around on horses!\\n\\n243. EXT. NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT\\nThe same newsstand we\\'ve seen all along -- but luckily, here in our\\nworld, the headlines are only mildly discouraging: \"RUSSIAN SUMMIT\\nTALKS COLLAPSE.\"  Like everyone else, our old friend the NEWS VENDOR\\nis gapin at the ruckus on the street.\\n\\nNEWS VENDOR\\nJesus Christ, it must be Halloween.\\n\\nHis sidekick, the small black KID who reads comic books, points to\\nthe befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition.\\n\\nKID\\nShit, man!  It\\'s Rorschach!  And Night Owl!\\n\\nNEWS VENDOR\\nWhat are you talkin\\' about?\\n\\nKID\\nSuperheroes!  Check it out!\\n\\nHe thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDOR\\'s hand and races off to\\njoin the growing throng of rubberneckers.  The NEWS VENDOR stares\\ndown at the costumed characters in the comic book -- \"WATCHMEN\" --\\nthen throws a cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the\\nstreet.\\n\\nKID\\nAll right!  They must be on a case.\\n\\n244. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\\nHORNS BLARE.  ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.  The intersection is mobbed\\nwith curious ONLOOKERS.  By now a half-dozen BEAT COPS have arrived\\nto clear the streets and restore order.\\n\\nCOP I\\nBreak it up!  Stand back!\\n\\nCOP II\\nCome on, you three.  If this is some kind of publicity stunt --\\n\\nDREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH have fallen into a tight circle.\\nThey don\\'t know what to expect and they\\'re poised for a brawl.  The\\ntaunting crowd gives them plenty of room; even the COPS are hesitant\\nto advance.\\n\\nLAURIE\\nDan -- what do we do now?\\n\\nDREIBERG\\n(panicked)\\nWherever we are, it\\'s better than what we left.  Backs together --\\n\\nLAURIE\\nWe\\'ll tell them what\\'s happened.  They\\'ll listen to reason, won\\'t\\nthey -- ?\\n\\nRORSCHACH\\nThey\\'d better.\\n\\nAnd on RORSCHACH\\'s final vicious HISS, we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and\\n\\nFADE OUT.\\n\\nTHE END' is too long - 'prompt'",

The depicted narrative should emblemize a sense of betrayal, brokenheartedness, and misunderstanding from a relationship gone wrong. Evoke the sense of the ongoing cycle of mendacity, the pain of seeing a loved one with someone else, and the ultimate decision to let go. Use visual elements to represent key plot points, such as trying to forget the other person in a party, the realization of deception in the midst of other people's arms, and the poignant farewell, symbolizing the protagonist's decision to move on.",

      "rewrittenPrompt": "A harsh flash illuminates an urban scene, evoking the grittiness and authenticity of street life, a predominant theme of the song 'Hoodrat'. At the center, a car of sleek appearance, symbolizing the allure and temptations of material wealth. This luxurious car is surrounded by hooded figures, subtly hinting at the song's refrain. The background is a grim, dilapidated neighborhood, contrasting sharply with the car's opulence. Everywhere the light touches, shadow is cast – a visual representation of the line 'let the light dim some'. It's a polarized world, marked by joy and despair, hope and disillusionment, as captured in this powerful hip-hop anthem.",

( No. 08-1448 )\n556 F. 3d 950, affirmed.\nSyllabus\n\nOpinion: Scalia\nConcurrence: Alito\nDissent: Thomas\nDissent: BreyerSyllabusSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\nBROWN, GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA, et al. v .\nENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSOCIATION et al.\n\nCertiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n\nNo. 08–1448. Argued November 2, 2010—Decided June 27, 2011\nRespondents, representing the video-game and software industries, filed a preenforcement challenge to a California law that restricts the sale or rental of violent video games to minors. The Federal District Court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined its enforcement. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\n\nHeld:  The Act does not comport with the First Amendment . Pp. 2–18.\n\n(a) Video games qualify for First Amendment protection. Like protected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through familiar literary devices and features distinctive to the medium. And “the basic principles of freedom of speech … do not vary” with a new and different communication medium. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson , 343 U. S. 495 . The most basic principle—that government lacks the power to restrict expression because of its message, ideas, subject matter, or content, Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union , 535 U. S. 564 —is subject to a few limited exceptions for historically unprotected speech, such as obscenity, incitement, and fighting words. But a legislature cannot create new categories of unprotected speech simply by weighing the value of a particular category against its social costs and then punishing it if it fails the test. See United States v. Stevens , 559 U. S. ___, ___. Unlike the New York law upheld in Ginsberg v. New York , 390 U. S. 629 , California’s Act does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children. Instead, the State wishes to create a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children. That is unprecedented and mistaken. This country has no tradition of specially restricting children’s access to depictions of violence. And California’s claim that “interactive” video games present special problems, in that the player participates in the violent action on screen and determines its outcome, is unpersuasive. Pp. 2–11.\n\n(b) Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny, i.e., it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest. R. A. V. v. St. Paul , 505 U. S. 377 . California cannot meet that standard. Psychological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively. Any demonstrated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media. Since California has declined to restrict those other media, e.g., Saturday morning cartoons, its video-game regulation is wildly underinclusive, raising serious doubts about whether the State is pursuing the interest it invokes or is instead disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint. California also cannot show that the Act’s restrictions meet the alleged substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children’s access to violent videos. The video-game industry’s voluntary rating system already accomplishes that to a large extent. Moreover, as a means of assisting parents the Act is greatly overinclusive, since not all of the children who are prohibited from purchasing violent video games have parents who disapprove of their doing so. The Act cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. Pp. 11–18.\n\n556 F. 3d 950, affirmed.\n\nScalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Alito, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Roberts, C. J., joined. Thomas, J., and Breyer, J., filed dissenting opinions.OPINION\nJustice Scalia delivered the Opinion of the CourtWe consider whether a California law imposing restrictions on violent video games comports with the First Amendment .ICalifornia Assembly Bill 1179 (2005), Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §§1746–1746.5 (West 2009) (Act), prohibits the sale or rental of “violent video games” to minors, and requires their packaging to be labeled “18.” The Act covers games “in which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being, if those acts are depicted” in a manner that “[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors,” that is “patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors,” and that “causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.” §1746(d)(1)(A). Violation of the Act is punishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. §1746.3.\nRespondents, representing the video-game and software industries, brought a preenforcement challenge to the Act in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. That court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined its enforcement. Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger , No. C–05–04188 RMW (2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. The Court of Appeals affirmed, Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger , 556 F. 3d 950 (CA9 2009), and we granted certiorari, 559 U. S. ____ (2010).IICalifornia correctly acknowledges that video games qualify for First Amendment protection. The Free Speech Clause exists principally to protect discourse on public matters, but we have long recognized that it is difficult to distinguish politics from entertainment, and dangerous to try. “Everyone is familiar with instances of propaganda through fiction. What is one man’s amusement, teaches another’s doctrine.” Winters v. New York , 333 U. S. 507, 510 (1948) . Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player’s interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection. Under our Constitution, “esthetic and moral judgments about art and literature … are for the individual to make, not for the Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval of a majority.” United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. , 529 U. S. 803, 818 (2000) . And whatever the challenges of applying the Constitution to ever-advancing technology, “the basic principles of freedom of speech and the press, like the First Amendment ’s command, do not vary” when a new and different medium for communication appears. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson , 343 U. S. 495, 503 (1952) .\n\nThe most basic of those principles is this: “[A]s a general matter, … government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union , 535 U. S. 564, 573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). There are of course exceptions. “ ‘From 1791 to the present,’ … the First Amendment has ‘permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,’ and has never ‘include[d] a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations.’ ” United States v. Stevens , 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (quoting R. A. V. v. St. Paul , 505 U. S. 377, 382–383 (1992) ). These limited areas—such as obscenity, Roth v. United States , 354 U. S. 476, 483 (1957) , incitement, Brandenburg v. Ohio , 395 U. S. 444, 447–449 (1969) (per curiam) , and fighting words, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire , 315 U. S. 568 , 572 (1942)—represent “well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,” id. , at 571–572.\n\nLast Term, in Stevens , we held that new categories of unprotected speech may not be added to the list by a legislature that concludes certain speech is too harmful to be tolerated. Stevens concerned a federal statute purporting to criminalize the creation, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty. See 18 U. S. C. §48 (amended 2010). The statute covered depictions “in which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed” if that harm to the animal was illegal where the “the creation, sale, or possession t[ook] place,” §48(c)(1). A saving clause largely borrowed from our obscenity jurisprudence, see Miller v. California , 413 U. S. 15, 24 (1973) , exempted depictions with “serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value,” §48(b). We held that statute to be an impermissible content-based restriction on speech. There was no American tradition of forbidding the depiction of animal cruelty—though States have long had laws against committing it.\n\nThe Government argued in Stevens that lack of a historical warrant did not matter; that it could create new categories of unprotected speech by applying a “simple balancing test” that weighs the value of a particular category of speech against its social costs and then punishes that category of speech if it fails the test. Stevens , 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). We emphatically rejected that “startling and dangerous” proposition. Ibid. “Maybe there are some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected, but have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 9). But without persuasive evidence that a novel restriction on content is part of a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of proscription, a legislature may not revise the “judgment [of] the American people,” embodied in the First Amendment , “that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the costs.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 7).\n\nThat holding controls this case. 1 As in Stevens , California has tried to make violent-speech regulation look like obscenity regulation by appending a saving clause required for the latter. That does not suffice. Our cases have been clear that the obscenity exception to the First Amendment does not cover whatever a legislature finds shocking, but only depictions of “sexual conduct,” Miller , supra, at 24. See also Cohen v. California , 403 U. S. 15, 20 (1971) ; Roth , supra, at 487, and n. 20.\n\nStevens was not the first time we have encountered and rejected a State’s attempt to shoehorn speech about violence into obscenity. In Winters , we considered a New York criminal statute “forbid[ding] the massing of stories of bloodshed and lust in such a way as to incite to crime against the person,” 333 U. S., at 514. The New York Court of Appeals upheld the provision as a law against obscenity. “[T]here can be no more precise test of written indecency or obscenity,” it said, “than the continuing and changeable experience of the community as to what types of books are likely to bring about the corruption of public morals or other analogous injury to the public order. ” Id. , at 514 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is of course the same expansive view of governmental power to abridge the freedom of speech based on interest-balancing that we rejected in Stevens . Our opinion in Winters , which concluded that the New York statute failed a heightened vagueness standard applicable to restrictions upon speech entitled to First Amendment protection, 333 U. S., at 517–519, made clear that violence is not part of the obscenity that the Constitution permits to be regulated. The speech reached by the statute contained “no indecency or obscenity in any sense heretofore known to the law.” Id. , at 519.\n\nBecause speech about violence is not obscene, it is of no consequence that California’s statute mimics the New York statute regulating obscenity-for-minors that we upheld in Ginsberg v. New York , 390 U. S. 629 (1968) . That case approved a prohibition on the sale to minors of sexual material that would be obscene from the perspective of a child. 2 We held that the legislature could “adjus[t] the definition of obscenity ‘to social realities by permitting the appeal of this type of material to be assessed in terms of the sexual interests …’ of … minors. ” Id. , at 638 (quoting Mishkin v. New York , 383 U. S. 502, 509 (1966) ). And because “obscenity is not protected expression,” the New York statute could be sustained so long as the legislature’s judgment that the proscribed materials were harmful to children “was not irrational.” 390 U. S., at 641.\n\nThe California Act is something else entirely. It does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children. California does not argue that it is empowered to prohibit selling offensively violent works to adults —and it is wise not to, since that is but a hair’s breadth from the argument rejected in Stevens . Instead, it wishes to create a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children.\n\nThat is unprecedented and mistaken. “[M]inors are entitled to a significant measure of First Amendment protection, and only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to them.” Erznoznik v. Jacksonville , 422 U. S. 205, 212–213 (1975) (citation omitted). No doubt a State possesses legitimate power to protect children from harm, Ginsberg , supra , at 640–641; Prince v. Massachusetts , 321 U. S. 158, 165 (1944) , but that does not include a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed. “Speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.” Erznoznik , supra, at 213–214. 3\n\nCalifornia’s argument would fare better if there were a longstanding tradition in this country of specially restricting children’s access to depictions of violence, but there is none. Certainly the books we give children to read—or read to them when they are younger—contain no shortage of gore. Grimm’s Fairy Tales, for example, are grim indeed. As her just deserts for trying to poison Snow White, the wicked queen is made to dance in red hot slippers “till she fell dead on the floor, a sad example of envy and jealousy.” The Complete Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales 198 (2006 ed.). Cinderella’s evil stepsisters have their eyes pecked out by doves. Id. , at 95. And Hansel and Gretel (children!) kill their captor by baking her in an oven. Id. , at 54.\n\nHigh-school reading lists are full of similar fare. Homer’s Odysseus blinds Polyphemus the Cyclops by grinding out his eye with a heated stake. The Odyssey of Homer, Book IX, p. 125 (S. Butcher & A. Lang transls. 1909) (“Even so did we seize the fiery-pointed brand and whirled it round in his eye, and the blood flowed about the heated bar. And the breath of the flame singed his eyelids and brows all about, as the ball of the eye burnt away, and the roots thereof crackled in the flame”). In the Inferno, Dante and Virgil watch corrupt politicians struggle to stay submerged beneath a lake of boiling pitch, lest they be skewered by devils above the surface. Canto XXI, pp. 187–189 (A. Mandelbaum transl. Bantam Classic ed. 1982). And Golding’s Lord of the Flies recounts how a schoolboy called Piggy is savagely murdered by other children while marooned on an island. W. Golding, Lord of the Flies 208–209 (1997 ed.). 4\n\nThis is not to say that minors’ consumption of violent entertainment has never encountered resistance. In the 1800’s, dime novels depicting crime and “penny dreadfuls” (named for their price and content) were blamed in some quarters for juvenile delinquency. See Brief for Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae 6–7. When motion pictures came along, they became the villains instead. “The days when the police looked upon dime novels as the most dangerous of textbooks in the school for crime are drawing to a close… . They say that the moving picture machine … tends even more than did the dime novel to turn the thoughts of the easily influenced to paths which sometimes lead to prison.” Moving Pictures as Helps to Crime, N. Y. Times, Feb. 21, 1909, quoted in Brief for Cato Institute, at 8. For a time, our Court did permit broad censorship of movies because of their capacity to be “used for evil,” see Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm’n of Ohio , 236 U. S. 230, 242 (1915) , but we eventually reversed course, Joseph Burstyn, Inc. , 343 U. S., at 502; see also Erznoznik , supra, at 212–214 (invalidating a drive-in movies restriction designed to protect children). Radio dramas were next, and then came comic books. Brief for Cato Institute, at 10–11. Many in the late 1940’s and early 1950’s blamed comic books for fostering a “preoccupation with violence and horror” among the young, leading to a rising juvenile crime rate. See Note, Regulation of Comic Books, 68 H arv . L. R ev . 489, 490 (1955). But efforts to convince Congress to restrict comic books failed. Brief for Comic Book Legal Defense Fund as Amicus Curiae 11–15. 5 And, of course, after comic books came television and music lyrics.\n\nCalifornia claims that video games present special problems because they are “interactive,” in that the player participates in the violent action on screen and determines its outcome. The latter feature is nothing new: Since at least the publication of The Adventures of You: Sugarcane Island in 1969, young readers of choose-your-own-adventure stories have been able to make decisions that determine the plot by following instructions about which page to turn to. Cf. Interactive Digital Software Assn. v. St. Louis County, 329 F. 3d 954, 957–958 (CA8 2003). As for the argument that video games enable participation in the violent action, that seems to us more a matter of degree than of kind. As Judge Posner has observed, all literature is interactive. “[T]he better it is, the more interactive. Literature when it is successful draws the reader into the story, makes him identify with the characters, invites him to judge them and quarrel with them, to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader’s own.” American Amusement Machine Assn. v. Kendrick , 244 F. 3d 572, 577 (CA7 2001) (striking down a similar restriction on violent video games).\nJustice Alito has done considerable independent re-search to identify, see post , at 14–15, nn. 13–18, video games in which “the violence is astounding,” post , at 14. “Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces. . . . Blood gushes, splatters, and pools.” Ibid. Justice Alito recounts all these disgusting video games in order to disgust us—but disgust is not a valid basis for restricting expression. And the same is true of Justice Alito ’s description, post , at 14–15, of those video games he has discovered that have a racial or ethnic motive for their violence—“ ‘ethnic cleansing’ [of] . . . African Americans, Latinos, or Jews.” To what end does he relate this? Does it somehow increase the “aggressiveness” that California wishes to suppress? Who knows? But it does arouse the reader’s ire, and the reader’s desire to put an end to this horrible message. Thus, ironically, Justice Alito ’s argument highlights the precise danger posed by the California Act: that the ideas expressed by speech—whether it be violence, or gore, or racism—and not its objective effects, may be the real reason for governmental proscription.IIIBecause the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny—that is, unless it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest. R. A. V. , 505 U. S., at 395. The State must specifically identify an “actual problem” in need of solving, Playboy , 529 U. S., at 822–823, and the curtailment of free speech must be actually necessary to the solution, see R. A. V. , supra, at 395. That is a demanding standard. “It is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible.” Playboy , supra, at 818.\n\nCalifornia cannot meet that standard. At the outset, it acknowledges that it cannot show a direct causal link between violent video games and harm to minors. Rather, relying upon our decision in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC , 512 U. S. 622 (1994) , the State claims that it need not produce such proof because the legislature can make a predictive judgment that such a link exists, based on competing psychological studies. But reliance on Turner Broadcasting is misplaced. That decision applied intermediate scrutiny to a content-neutral regulation. Id. , at 661–662. California’s burden is much higher, and because it bears the risk of uncertainty, see Playboy , supra, at 816–817, ambiguous proof will not suffice.\n\nThe State’s evidence is not compelling. California relies primarily on the research of Dr. Craig Anderson and a few other research psychologists whose studies purport to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children. These studies have been rejected by every court to consider them, 6 and with good reason: They do not prove that violent video games cause minors to act aggressively (which would at least be a beginning). Instead, “[n]early all of the research is based on correlation, not evidence of causation, and most of the studies suffer from significant, admitted flaws in methodology.” Video Software Dealers Assn. 556 F. 3d, at 964. They show at best some correlation between exposure to violent entertainment and minuscule real-world effects, such as children’s feeling more aggressive or making louder noises in the few minutes after playing a violent game than after playing a nonviolent game. 7\n\nEven taking for granted Dr. Anderson’s conclusions that violent video games produce some effect on children’s feelings of aggression, those effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media. In his testimony in a similar lawsuit, Dr. Anderson admitted that the “effect sizes” of children’s exposure to violent video games are “about the same” as that produced by their exposure to violence on television. App. 1263. And he admits that the same effects have been found when children watch cartoons starring Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner, id., at 1304, or when they play video games like Sonic the Hedgehog that are rated “E” (appropriate for all ages), id., at 1270, or even when they “vie[w] a picture of a gun,” id., at 1315–1316. 8\n\nOf course, California has (wisely) declined to restrict Saturday morning cartoons, the sale of games rated for young children, or the distribution of pictures of guns. The consequence is that its regulation is wildly underinclusive when judged against its asserted justification, which in our view is alone enough to defeat it. Underinclusiveness raises serious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint. See City of Ladue v. Gilleo , 512 U. S. 43, 51 (1994) ; Florida Star v. B. J. F. , 491 U. S. 524, 540 (1989) . Here, California has singled out the purveyors of video games for disfavored treatment—at least when compared to booksellers, cartoonists, and movie producers—and has given no persuasive reason why.\n\nThe Act is also seriously underinclusive in another respect—and a respect that renders irrelevant the contentions of the concurrence and the dissents that video games are qualitatively different from other portrayals of violence. The California Legislature is perfectly willing to leave this dangerous, mind-altering material in the hands of children so long as one parent (or even an aunt or uncle) says it’s OK. And there are not even any requirements as to how this parental or avuncular relationship is to be verified; apparently the child’s or putative parent’s, aunt’s, or uncle’s say-so suffices. That is not how one addresses a serious social problem.\n\nCalifornia claims that the Act is justified in aid of parental authority: By requiring that the purchase of violent video games can be made only by adults, the Act ensures that parents can decide what games are appropriate. At the outset, we note our doubts that punishing third parties for conveying protected speech to children just in case their parents disapprove of that speech is a proper governmental means of aiding parental authority. Accepting that position would largely vitiate the rule that “only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to [minors].” Erznoznik , 422 U. S., at 212–213.\n\nBut leaving that aside, California cannot show that the Act’s restrictions meet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children’s access to violent video games but cannot do so. The video-game industry has in place a voluntary rating system designed to inform consumers about the content of games. The system, implemented by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), assigns age-specific ratings to each video game submitted: EC (Early Childhood); E (Everyone); E10+ (Everyone 10 and older); T (Teens); M (17 and older); and AO (Adults Only—18 and older). App. 86. The Video Software Dealers Association encourages retailers to prominently display information about the ESRB system in their stores; to refrain from renting or selling adults-only games to minors; and to rent or sell “M” rated games to minors only with parental consent. Id., at 47. In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that, as a result of this system, “the video game industry outpaces the movie and music industries” in “(1) restricting target-marketing of mature-rated products to children; (2) clearly and prominently disclosing rating information; and (3) re-stricting children’s access to mature-rated products at retail.” FTC, Report to Congress, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 30 (Dec. 2009), online at http:// www.ftc.gov / os/ 2009 / 12/ P994511violententertainment.pdf (as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file) (FTC Report). This system does much to ensure that minors cannot purchase seriously violent games on their own, and that parents who care about the matter can readily evaluate the games their children bring home. Filling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents’ control can hardly be a compelling state interest. 9\n\nAnd finally, the Act’s purported aid to parental authority is vastly overinclusive. Not all of the children who are forbidden to purchase violent video games on their own have parents who care whether they purchase violent video games. While some of the legislation’s effect may indeed be in support of what some parents of the restricted children actually want, its entire effect is only in support of what the State thinks parents ought to want. This is not the narrow tailoring to “assisting parents” that restriction of First Amendment rights requires.\n\n*  *  *\n\nCalifornia’s effort to regulate violent video games is the latest episode in a long series of failed attempts to censor violent entertainment for minors. While we have pointed out above that some of the evidence brought forward to support the harmfulness of video games is unpersuasive, we do not mean to demean or disparage the concerns that underlie the attempt to regulate them—concerns that may and doubtless do prompt a good deal of parental oversight. We have no business passing judgment on the view of the California Legislature that violent video games (or, for that matter, any other forms of speech) corrupt the young or harm their moral development. Our task is only to say whether or not such works constitute a “well-defined and narrowly limited clas[s] of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,” Chaplinsky , 315 U. S., at 571–572 (the answer plainly is no); and if not, whether the regulation of such works is justified by that high degree of necessity we have described as a compelling state interest (it is not). Even where the protection of children is the object, the constitutional limits on governmental action apply.\n\nCalifornia’s legislation straddles the fence between (1) addressing a serious social problem and (2) helping concerned parents control their children. Both ends are legitimate, but when they affect First Amendment rights they must be pursued by means that are neither seriously underinclusive nor seriously overinclusive. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520, 546 (1993) . As a means of protecting children from portrayals of violence, the legislation is seriously underinclusive, not only because it excludes portrayals other than video games, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular veto. And as a means of assisting concerned parents it is seriously overinclusive because it abridges the First Amendment rights of young people whose parents (and aunts and uncles) think violent video games are a harmless pastime. And the overbreadth in achieving one goal is not cured by the underbreadth in achieving the other. Legislation such as this, which is neither fish nor fowl, cannot survive strict scrutiny.\n\nWe affirm the judgment below.\nIt is so ordered.Justice ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring in the judgment.The California statute that is before us in this case represents a pioneering effort to address what the state legislature and others regard as a potentially serious social problem: the effect of exceptionally violent video games on impressionable minors, who often spend countless hours immersed in the alternative worlds that these games create. Although the California statute is well intentioned, its terms are not framed with the precision that the Constitution demands, and I therefore agree with the Court that this particular law cannot be sustained.\n\nI disagree, however, with the approach taken in the Court's opinion. In considering the application of unchanging constitutional principles to new and rapidly evolving technology, this Court should proceed with caution. We should make every effort to understand the new technology. We should take into account the possibility that developing technology may have important societal implications that will become apparent only with time. We should not jump to the conclusion that new technology is fundamentally the same as some older thing with which we are familiar. And we should not hastily dismiss the judgment of legislators, who may be in a better position than we are to assess the implications of new technology. The opinion of the Court exhibits none of this caution.\n\nIn the view of the Court, all those concerned about the effects of violent video games—federal and state legislators, educators, social scientists, and parents—are unduly fearful, for violent video games really present no serious problem. See ante, at 2737-2739, 2740-2741. Spending hour upon hour controlling the actions of a character who guns down scores of innocent victims is not different in \"kind\" from reading a description of violence in a work of literature. See ante, at 2737-2738.\n\nThe Court is sure of this; I am not. There are reasons to suspect that the experience of playing violent video games just might be very different from reading a book, listening to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show.IRespondents in this case, representing the video-game industry, ask us to strike down the California law on two grounds: The broad ground adopted by the Court and the narrower ground that the law's definition of \"violent video game,\" see Cal. Civ.Code Ann. § 1746(d)(1)(A) (West 2009), is impermissibly vague. See Brief for Respondents 23-61. Because I agree with the latter argument, I see no need to reach the broader First Amendment issues addressed by the Court.[1]ADue process requires that laws give people of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited. Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). The lack of such notice in a law that regulates expression \"raises special First Amendment concerns because of its obvious chilling effect on free speech.\" Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 871-872, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997). Vague laws force potential speakers to \"`steer far wider of the unlawful zone' . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\" Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 372, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964) (quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958)). While \"perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity,\" Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 794, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989), \"government may regulate in the area\" of First Amendment freedoms \"only with narrow specificity,\" NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963); see also Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). These principles apply to laws that regulate expression for the purpose of protecting children. See Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas, 390 U.S. 676, 689, 88 S.Ct. 1298, 20 L.Ed.2d 225 (1968).\n\nHere, the California law does not define \"violent video games\" with the \"narrow specificity\" that the Constitution demands. In an effort to avoid First Amendment problems, the California Legislature modeled its violent video game statute on the New York law that this Court upheld in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968)—a law that prohibited the sale of certain sexually related materials to minors, see id., at 631-633, 88 S.Ct. 1274. But the California Legislature departed from the Ginsberg model in an important respect, and the legislature overlooked important differences between the materials falling within the scope of the two statutes.BThe law at issue in Ginsberg prohibited the sale to minors of materials that were deemed \"harmful to minors,\" and the law defined \"harmful to minors\" simply by adding the words \"for minors\" to each element of the definition of obscenity set out in what were then the Court's leading obscenity decisions, see Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957), and Book Named \"John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\" v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975, 16 L.Ed.2d 1 (1966).\n\nSeeking to bring its violent video game law within the protection of Ginsberg, the California Legislature began with the obscenity test adopted in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), a decision that revised the obscenity tests previously set out in Roth and Memoirs. The legislature then made certain modifications to accommodate the aim of the violent video game law.\n\nUnder Miller, an obscenity statute must contain a thresh-old limitation that restricts the statute's scope to specifically described \"hard core\" materials. See 413 U.S., at 23-25, 27, 93 S.Ct. 2607. Materials that fall within this \"hard core\" category may be deemed to be obscene if three additional requirements are met:\n\n(1) an \"average person, applying contemporary community standards [must] find . . . the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\";\n\n(2) \"the work [must] depic[t] or describ[e], in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and\"\n\n(3) \"the work, taken as a whole, [must] lac[k] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\" Id., at 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAdapting these standards, the California law imposes the following threshold limitation: \"[T]he range of options available to a player [must] includ[e] killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being.\" § 1746(d)(1). Any video game that meets this threshold test is subject to the law's restrictions if it also satisfies three further requirements:(i) A reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find [the game] appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors.\n\n\"(ii) It is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors.\n\n\"(iii) It causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\" § 1746(d)(1)(A).[2]CThe first important difference between the Ginsberg law and the California violent video game statute concerns their respective threshold requirements. As noted, the Ginsberg law built upon the test for adult obscenity, and the current adult obscenity test, which was set out in Miller, requires an obscenity statute to contain a threshold limitation that restricts the statute's coverage to specifically defined \"hard core\" depictions. See 413 U.S., at 23-25, 27, 93 S.Ct. 2607. The Miller Court gave as an example a statute that applies to only \"[p]atently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts,\" \"masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.\" Id., at 25, 93 S.Ct. 2607. The Miller Court clearly viewed this threshold limitation as serving a vital notice function. \"We are satisfied,\" the Court wrote, \"that these specific prerequisites will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials that his public and commercial activities may bring prosecution.\" Id., at 27, 93 S.Ct. 2607; see also Reno, supra, at 873, 117 S.Ct. 2329 (observing that Miller's threshold limitation \"reduces the vagueness inherent in the open-ended term `patently offensive'\").[3]\n\nBy contrast, the threshold requirement of the California law does not perform the narrowing function served by the limitation in Miller. At least when Miller was decided, depictions of \"hard core\" sexual conduct were not a common feature of mainstream entertainment. But nothing similar can be said about much of the conduct covered by the California law. It provides that a video game cannot qualify as \"violent\" unless \"the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being.\" § 1746(d)(1).\n\nFor better or worse, our society has long regarded many depictions of killing and maiming[4] as suitable features of popular entertainment, including entertainment that is widely available to minors. The California law's threshold requirement would more closely resemble the limitation in Miller if it targeted a narrower class of graphic depictions.\n\nBecause of this feature of the California law's threshold test, the work of providing fair notice is left in large part to the three requirements that follow, but those elements are also not up to the task. In drafting the violent video game law, the California Legislature could have made its own judgment regarding the kind and degree of violence that is acceptable in games played by minors (or by minors in particular age groups). Instead, the legislature relied on undefined societal or community standards.\n\nOne of the three elements at issue here refers expressly to \"prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors.\" § 1746(d)(1)(A)(ii). Another element points in the same direction, asking whether \"[a] reasonable person, considering [a] game as a whole,\" would find that it \"appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors.\" § 1746(d)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added).\n\nThe terms \"deviant\" and \"morbid\" are not defined in the statute, and California offers no reason to think that its courts would give the terms anything other than their ordinary meaning. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 5 (arguing that \"[a] reasonable person can make this judgment through . . . a common understanding and definition of the applicable terms\"). I therefore assume that \"deviant\" and \"morbid\" carry the meaning that they convey in ordinary speech. The adjective \"deviant\" ordinarily means \"deviating . . . from some accepted norm,\" and the term \"morbid\" means \"of, relating to, or characteristic of disease.\" Webster's 618, 1469. A \"deviant or morbid interest\" in violence, therefore, appears to be an interest that deviates from what is regarded—presumably in accordance with some generally accepted standard—as normal and healthy. Thus, the application of the California law is heavily dependent on the identification of generally accepted standards regarding the suitability of violent entertainment for minors.\n\nThe California Legislature seems to have assumed that these standards are sufficiently well known so that a person of ordinary intelligence would have fair notice as to whether the kind and degree of violence in a particular game is enough to qualify the game as \"violent.\" And because the Miller test looks to community standards, the legislature may have thought that the use of undefined community standards in the violent video game  law would not present vagueness problems.\n\nThere is a critical difference, however, between obscenity laws and laws regulating violence in entertainment. By the time of this Court's landmark obscenity cases in the 1960's, obscenity had long been prohibited, see Roth, 354 U.S., at 484-485, 77 S.Ct. 1304, and this experience had helped to shape certain generally accepted norms concerning expression related to sex.\n\nThere is no similar history regarding expression related to violence. As the Court notes, classic literature contains descriptions of great violence, and even children's stories sometimes depict very violent scenes. See ante, at 2736-2737.\n\nAlthough our society does not generally regard all depictions of violence as suitable for children or adolescents, the prevalence of violent depictions in children's literature and entertainment creates numerous opportunities for reasonable people to disagree about which depictions may excite \"deviant\" or \"morbid\" impulses. See Edwards & Berman, Regulating Violence on Television, 89 Nw. U.L.Rev. 1487, 1523 (1995) (observing that the Miller test would be difficult to apply to violent expression because \"there is nothing even approaching a consensus on low-value violence\").\n\nFinally, the difficulty of ascertaining the community standards incorporated into the California law is compounded by the legislature's decision to lump all minors together. The California law draws no distinction between young children and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority.\n\nIn response to a question at oral argument, the attorney defending the constitutionality of the California law said that the State would accept a narrowing construction of the law under which the law's references to \"minors\" would be interpreted to refer to the oldest minors—that is, those just short of 18. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12. However, \"it is not within our power to construe and narrow state laws.\" Grayned, 408 U.S., at 110, 92 S.Ct. 2294. We can only \"`extrapolate [their] allowable meaning'\" from the statutory text and authoritative interpretations of similar laws by courts of the State. Ibid. (quoting Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U.S. 157, 174, 82 S.Ct. 248, 7 L.Ed.2d 207 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment)).\n\nIn this case, California has not provided any evidence that the California Legislature intended the law to be limited in this way, or cited any decisions from its courts that would support an \"oldest minors\" construction.[5]\n\nFor these reasons, I conclude that the California violent video game law fails to provide the fair notice that the Constitution requires. And I would go no further. I would not express any view on whether a properly drawn statute would or would not survive First Amendment scrutiny. We should address that question only if and when it is necessary to do so.IIHaving outlined how I would decide this case, I will now briefly elaborate on my reasons for questioning the wisdom of the Court's approach. Some of these reasons are touched upon by the dissents, and while I am not prepared at this time to go as far as either Justice THOMAS or Justice BREYER, they raise valid concerns.AThe Court is wrong in saying that the holding in United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010), \"controls this case.\" Ante, at 2734. First, the statute in Stevens differed sharply from the statute at issue here. Stevens struck down a law that broadly prohibited any person from creating, selling, or possessing depictions of animal cruelty for commercial gain. The California law involved here, by contrast, is limited to the sale or rental of violent video games to minors. The California law imposes no restriction on the creation of violent video games, or on the possession of such games by anyone, whether above or below the age of 18. The California law does not regulate the sale or rental of violent games by adults. And the California law does not prevent parents and certain other close relatives from buying or renting violent games for their children or other young relatives if they see fit.\n\nSecond, Stevens does not support the proposition that a law like the one at issue must satisfy strict scrutiny. The portion of Stevens on which the Court relies rejected the Government's contention that depictions of animal cruelty were categorically outside the range of any First Amendment protection. 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1582. Going well beyond Stevens, the Court now holds that any law that attempts to prevent minors from purchasing violent video games must satisfy strict scrutiny instead of the more lenient standard applied in Ginsberg, 390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195, our most closely related precedent. As a result of today's decision, a State may prohibit the sale to minors of what Ginsberg described as \"girlie magazines,\" but a State must surmount a formidable (and perhaps insurmountable) obstacle if it wishes to prevent children from purchasing the most violent and depraved video games imaginable.\n\nThird, Stevens expressly left open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute targeting depictions of animal cruelty might be compatible with the First Amendment. See 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1592. In this case, the Court's sweeping opinion will likely be read by many, both inside and outside the video-game industry, as suggesting that no regulation of minors' access to violent video games is allowed—at least without supporting evidence that may not be realistically obtainable given the nature of the phenomenon in question.BThe Court's opinion distorts the effect of the California law. I certainly agree with the Court that the government has no \"free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed,\" ante, at 2736, but the California law does not exercise such a power. If parents want their child to have a violent video game, the California law does not interfere with that parental prerogative. Instead, the California law reinforces parental decisionmaking in exactly the same way as the New York statute upheld in Ginsberg. Under both laws, minors are prevented from purchasing certain materials; and under both laws, parents are free to supply their children with these items if that is their wish.\n\nCiting the video-game industry's voluntary rating system, the Court argues that the California law does not \"meet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children's access to violent video games but cannot do so.\" Ante, at 2740. The Court does not mention the fact that the industry adopted this system in response to the threat of federal regulation, Brief for Activision Blizzard, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 7-10, a threat that the Court's opinion may now be seen as largely eliminating. Nor does the Court acknowledge that compliance with this system at the time of the enactment of the California law left much to be desired[6]— or that future enforcement may decline if the video-game industry perceives that any threat of government regulation has vanished. Nor does the Court note, as Justice BREYER points out, see post, at 2767 (dissenting opinion), that many parents today are simply not able to monitor their children's use of computers and gaming devices.CFinally, the Court is far too quick to dismiss the possibility that the experience of playing video games (and the effects on minors of playing violent video games) may be very different from anything that we have seen before. Any assessment of the experience of playing video games must take into account certain characteristics of the video games that are now on the market and those that are likely to be available in the near future.\n\nToday's most advanced video games create realistic alternative worlds in which millions of players immerse themselves for hours on end. These games feature visual imagery and sounds that are strikingly realistic, and in the near future video-game graphics may be virtually indistinguishable from actual video footage.[7] Many of the games already on the market can produce high definition images,[8] and it is predicted that it will not be long before video-game images will be seen in three dimensions.[9] It is also forecast that video games will soon provide sensory feedback.[10] By wearing a special vest or other device, a player will be able to experience physical sensations supposedly felt by a character  on the screen.[11] Some amici who support respondents foresee the day when \"`virtual-reality shoot-`em-ups'\" will allow children to \"`actually feel the splatting blood from the blown-off head'\" of a victim. Brief for Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press et al. as Amici Curiae 29 (quoting H. Schechter, Savage Pastimes 18 (2005)).\n\nPersons who play video games also have an unprecedented ability to participate in the events that take place in the virtual worlds that these games create. Players can create their own video-game characters and can use photos to produce characters that closely resemble actual people. A person playing a sophisticated game can make a multitude of choices and can thereby alter the course of the action in the game. In addition, the means by which players control the action in video games now bear a closer relationship to the means by which people control action in the real world. While the action in older games was often directed with buttons or a joystick, players dictate the action in newer games by engaging in the same motions that they desire a character in the game to perform.[12] For example, a player who wants a video-game character to swing a baseball bat—either to hit a ball or smash a skull—could bring that about by simulating the motion of actually swinging a bat.\n\nThese present-day and emerging characteristics of video games must be considered together with characteristics of the violent games that have already been marketed.\n\nIn some of these games, the violence is astounding.[13] Victims by the dozens are killed with every imaginable implement, including machine guns, shotguns, clubs, hammers, axes, swords, and chainsaws. Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces. They cry out in agony and beg for mercy. Blood gushes, splatters, and pools. Severed body parts and gobs of human remains are graphically shown. In some games, points are awarded based, not only on the number of victims killed, but on the killing technique employed.\n\nIt also appears that there is no antisocial theme too base for some in the video-game industry to exploit. There are games in which a player can take on the identity and reenact the killings carried out by the perpetrators of the murders at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech.[14] The objective of one game is to rape a mother and her daughters;[15] in another, the goal is to rape Native American women.[16] There is a game in which players engage in \"ethnic cleansing\" and can choose to gun down African-Americans, Latinos, or Jews.[17] In still another game, players attempt to fire a rifle shot into the head of President Kennedy as his motorcade passes by the Texas School Book Depository.[18]\n\nIf the technological characteristics of the sophisticated games that are likely to be available in the near future are combined with the characteristics of the most violent games already marketed, the result will be games that allow troubled teens to experience in an extraordinarily personal and vivid way what it would be like to carry out unspeakable acts of violence.\n\nThe Court is untroubled by this possibility. According to the Court, the \"interactive\" nature of video games is \"nothing new\" because \"all literature is interactive.\" Ante, at 2738. Disagreeing with this assessment, the International Game Developers Association (IGDA)—a group that presumably understands the nature of video games and that supports respondents— tells us that video games are \"far more concretely interactive.\" Brief for IGDA et al. as Amici Curiae 3. And on this point, the game developers are surely correct.\n\nIt is certainly true, as the Court notes, that \"`[l]iterature, when it is successful draws the reader into the story, makes him identify with the characters, invites him to judge them and quarrel with them, to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader's own.'\" Ante, at 2738 (quoting American Amusement Machine Assn. v. Kendrick, 244 F.3d 572, 577 (C.A.7 2001)). But only an extraordinarily imaginative reader who reads a description of a killing in a literary work will experience that event as vividly as he might if he played the role of the killer in a video game. To take an example, think of a person who reads the passage in Crime and Punishment in which Raskolnikov kills the old pawn broker with an axe. See F. Dostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment 78 (Modern Library ed.1950). Compare that reader with a video-game player who creates an avatar that bears his own image; who sees a realistic image of the victim and the scene of the killing in high definition and in three dimensions; who is forced to decide whether or not to kill the victim and decides to do so; who then pretends to grasp an axe, to raise it above the head of the victim, and then to bring it down; who hears the thud of the axe hitting her head and her cry of pain; who sees her split skull and feels the sensation of blood on his face and hands. For most people, the two experiences will not be the same.[19]\n\nWhen all of the characteristics of video games are taken into account, there is certainly a reasonable basis for thinking that the experience of playing a video game may be quite different from the experience of reading a book, listening to a radio broadcast, or viewing a movie. And if this is so, then for at least some minors, the effects of playing violent video games may also be quite different. The Court acts prematurely in dismissing this possibility out of hand.\n\n* * *\n\nFor all these reasons, I would hold only that the particular law at issue here fails to provide the clear notice that the Constitution requires. I would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem. If differently framed statutes are enacted by the States or by the Federal Government, we can consider the constitutionality of those laws when cases challenging them are presented to us.Justice THOMAS, dissenting.The Court's decision today does not comport with the original public understanding of the First Amendment. The majority strikes down, as facially unconstitutional, a state law that prohibits the direct sale or rental of certain video games to minors because the law \"abridg[es] the freedom of speech.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 1. But I do not think the First Amendment stretches that far. The practices and beliefs of the founding generation establish that \"the freedom of speech,\" as originally understood, does not include a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents or guardians. I would hold that the law at issue is not facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment, and reverse and remand for further proceedings.[1]IWhen interpreting a constitutional provision, \"the goal is to discern the most likely public understanding of [that] provision at the time it was adopted.\" McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___, ___, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 3072, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Because the Constitution is a written instrument, \"its meaning does not alter.\" McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S. 334, 359, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"That which it meant when adopted, it means now.\" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAs originally understood, the First Amendment's protection against laws \"abridging the freedom of speech\" did not extend to all speech. \"There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem.\" Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571-572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942); see also United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S.  ___, ___, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 1582-1583, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010). Laws regulating such speech do not \"abridg[e] the freedom of speech\" because such speech is understood to fall outside \"the freedom of speech.\" See Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 245-246, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002).\n\nIn my view, the \"practices and beliefs held by the Founders\" reveal another category of excluded speech: speech to minor children bypassing their parents. McIntyre, supra, at 360, 115 S.Ct. 1511. The historical evidence shows that the founding generation believed parents had absolute authority over their minor children and expected parents to use that authority to direct the proper development of their children. It would be absurd to suggest that such a society understood \"the freedom of speech\" to include a right to speak to minors (or a corresponding right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents. Cf. Brief for Common Sense Media as Amicus Curiae 12-15. The founding generation would not have considered it an abridgment of \"the freedom of speech\" to support parental authority by restricting speech that bypasses minors' parents.AAttitudes toward children were in a state of transition around the time that the States ratified the Bill of Rights. A complete understanding of the founding generation's views on children and the parent-child relationship must therefore begin roughly a century earlier, in colonial New England.\n\nIn the Puritan tradition common in the New England Colonies, fathers ruled families with absolute authority. \"The patriarchal family was the basic building block of Puritan society.\" S. Mintz, Huck's Raft 13 (2004) (hereinafter Mintz); see also R. MacDonald, Literature for Children in England and America from 1646 to 1774, p. 7 (1982) (hereinafter MacDonald). The Puritans rejected many customs, such as godparenthood, that they considered inconsistent with the patriarchal structure. Mintz 13.\n\nPart of the father's absolute power was the right and duty \"to fill his children's minds with knowledge and . . . make them apply their knowledge in right action.\" E. Morgan, The Puritan Family 97 (rev. ed.1966) (herein-after Morgan). Puritans thought children were \"innately sinful and that parents' primary task was to suppress their children's natural depravity.\" S. Mintz & S. Kellogg, Domestic Revolutions 2 (1988) (hereinafter Mintz & Kellogg); see also B. Wadsworth, The Well-Ordered Family 55 (1712) (\"Children should not be left to themselves . . . to do as they please;. . . not being fit to govern themselves\"); C. Mather, A Family Well-Ordered 38 (1699). Accordingly, parents were not to let their children read \"vain Books, profane Ballads, and filthy Songs\" or \"fond and amorous Romances, . . . fabulous Histories of Giants, the bombast Achievements of Knight Errantry, and the like.\" The History of Genesis, pp. vi-vii (3d ed. corrected 1708).\n\nThis conception of parental authority was reflected in laws at that time. In the Massachusetts Colony, for example, it was unlawful for tavern keepers (or anyone else) to entertain children without their parents' consent. 2 Records and Files of the Quarterly Courts of Essex County, Massachusetts, p. 180 (1912); 4 id., at 237, 275 (1914); 5 id., at 143 (1916); see also Morgan 146. And a \"stubborn or rebellious son\" of 16 years or more committed a capital offense if he disobeyed \"the voice of his Father, or the voice of his Mother.\" The Laws and Liberties of Massachusetts 6 (1648) (reprint M. Farrand ed.1929); see also J. Kamensky, Governing the Tongue 102, n. 14 (1997) (citing similar laws in the Connecticut, New Haven, Plymouth, and New Hampshire Colonies in the late 1600's).BIn the decades leading up to and following the Revolution, attitudes towards children changed. See, e.g., J. Reinier, From Virtue to Character: American Childhood, 1775-1850, p. 1 (1996) (hereinafter Reinier). Children came to be seen less as innately sinful and more as blank slates requiring careful and deliberate development. But the same overarching principles remained. Parents continued to have both the right and duty to ensure the proper development of their children. They exercised significant authority over their children, including control over the books that children read. And laws at the time continued to reflect strong support for parental authority and the sense that children were not fit to govern themselves.1The works of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were a driving force behind the changed understanding of children and childhood. See Reinier 2-5; H. Brewer, By Birth or Consent 97 (2005) (hereinafter Brewer); K. Calvert, Children in the House 59-60 (1992) (hereinafter Calvert). Locke taught that children's minds were blank slates and that parents therefore had to be careful and deliberate about what their children were told and observed. Parents had only themselves to blame if, \"by humouring and cockering\" their children, they \"poison'd the fountain\" and later \"taste[d] the bitter waters.\" Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1692), in 37 English Philosophers of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries 27-28 (C. Eliot ed.1910). All vices, he explained, were sowed by parents and \"those about children.\" Id., at 29. Significantly, Locke did not suggest circumscribing parental authority but rather articulated a new basis for it. Rousseau disagreed with Locke in important respects, but his philosophy was similarly premised on parental control over a child's development. Although Rousseau advocated that children should be allowed to develop naturally, he instructed that the environment be directed by \"a tutor who is given total control over the child and who removes him from society, from all competing sources of authority and influence.\" J. Fliegelman, Prodigals and Pilgrims 30 (1982) (hereinafter Fliegelman); see also Reinier 15.\n\nThese writings received considerable attention in America. Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and his Some Thoughts Concerning Education were significantly more popular than his Two Treatises of Government, according to a study of 92 colonial libraries between 1700 and 1776. Lundberg & May, The Enlightened Reader in America, 28 American Quarterly 262, 273 (1976) (hereinafter Lundberg). And Rousseau's Emile, a treatise on education, was more widely advertised and distributed than his political work, The Social Contract. Fliegelman 29; see also Lundberg 285. In general, the most popular books in the Colonies on the eve of the American Revolution were not political discourses but ones concerned with child rearing. See Mintz & Kellogg 45.2Locke's and Rousseau's writings fostered a new conception of childhood. Children were increasingly viewed as malleable creatures, and childhood came to be seen as an important period of growth, development, and preparation for adulthood. See Mintz & Kellogg 17, 21, 47; M. Grossberg, Governing the Hearth 8 (1985) (hereinafter Grossberg). Noah Webster, called the father of American education, wrote that \"[t]he impressions received in early life usually form the characters of individuals.\" On the Education of Youth in America (1790) (hereinafter Webster), in Essays on Education in the Early Republic 43 (F. Rudolph ed.1965) (hereinafter Rudolph); cf. Slater, Noah Webster: Founding Father of American Scholarship and Education, in Noah Webster's First Edition of an American Dictionary of the English Language (1967). Elizabeth Smith, sister-in-law to John Adams, similarly wrote: \"The Infant Mind, I beleive[,] is a blank, that eassily receives any impression.\" M. Norton, Liberty's Daughters 101 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted) (hereinafter Norton); see also S. Doggett, A Discourse on Education (1796) (hereinafter Doggett), in Rudolph 151 (\"[I]n early youth, . . . every power and capacity is pliable and susceptible of any direction or impression\"); J. Abbott, The Mother at Home 2 (1834) (hereinafter Abbott) (\"What impressions can be more strong, and more lasting, than those received upon the mind in the freshness and the susceptibility of youth\").\n\nChildren lacked reason and decisionmaking ability. They \"have not Judgment or Will of their own,\" John Adams noted. Letter to James Sullivan (May 26, 1776), in 4 Papers of John Adams 210 (R. Taylor ed.1979); see also Vol. 1 1787: Drafting the Constitution, p. 229 (W. Benton ed.1986) (quoting Gouvernor Morris in James Madison's notes from the Constitutional Convention explaining that children do not vote because they \"want prudence\" and \"have no will of their own\"). Children's \"utter incapacity\" rendered them \"almost wholly at the mercy of their Parents or Instructors for a set of habits to regulate their whole conduct through life.\" J. Burgh, Thoughts on Education 7 (1749) (hereinafter Burgh).\n\nThis conception of childhood led to great concern about influences on children. \"Youth are ever learning to do what they see others around them doing, and these imitations grow into habits.\" Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also B. Rush, A Plan for the Establishment of Public Schools (1786) (hereinafter Rush), in Rudolph 16 (\"The vices of young people are generally learned from each other\"); Webster, in Rudolph 58 (\"[C]hildren, artless and unsuspecting, resign their hearts to any person whose manners are agreeable and whose conduct is respectable\"). Books therefore advised parents \"not to put children in the way of those whom you dare not trust.\" L. Child, The Mother's Book 149 (1831) (hereinafter Child); see also S. Coontz, The Social Origins of Private Life 149-150 (1988) (noting that it was \"considered dangerous to leave children to the supervision of servants or apprentices\").\n\nAs a result, it was widely accepted that children needed close monitoring and carefully planned development. See B. Wishy, The Child and the Republic 24-25, 32 (1968) (hereinafter Wishy); Grossberg 8. Managing the young mind was considered \"infinitely important.\" Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also A. MacLeod, A Moral Tale 72-73 (1975) (hereinafter MacLeod). In an essay on the education of youth in America, Noah Webster described the human mind as \"a rich field, which, without constant care, will ever be covered with a luxuriant growth of weeds.\" Rudolph 54. He advocated sheltering children from \"every low-bred, drunken, immoral character\" and keeping their minds \"untainted till their reasoning faculties have acquired strength and the good principles which may be planted in their minds have taken deep root.\" Id., at 63; see also Rush, in id., at 16 (\"[T]he most useful citizens have  been formed from those youth who have never known or felt their own wills till they were one and twenty years of age\"); Burgh 7 (\"[T]he souls of Youth are more immediately committed to the care of Parents and Instructors than even those of a People are to their Pastor\").\n\nThe Revolution only amplified these concerns. The Republic would require virtuous citizens, which necessitated proper training from childhood. See Mintz 54, 71; MacLeod 40; Saxton, French and American Childhoods, in Children and Youth in a New Nation 69 (J. Marten ed.2009) (hereinafter Marten); see also W. Cardell, Story of Jack Halyard, pp. xv-xvi (30th ed. 1834) (hereinafter Cardell) (\"[T]he glory and efficacy of our institutions will soon rest with those who are growing up to succede us\"). Children were \"the pivot of the moral world,\" and their proper development was \"a subject of as high interest, as any to which the human mind ha[d] ever been called.\" Id., at xvi.3Based on these views of childhood, the founding generation understood parents to have a right and duty to govern their children's growth. Parents were expected to direct the development and education of their children and ensure that bad habits did not take root. See Calvert 58-59; MacLeod 72; Mintz & Kellogg 23. They were responsible for instilling \"moral prohibitions, behavioral standards, and a capacity for self-government that would prepare a child for the outside world.\" Mintz & Kellogg 58; see also Youth's Companion, Apr. 16, 1827, p. 1 (hereinafter Youth's Companion) (\"Let [children's] minds be formed, their hearts prepared, and their characters moulded for the scenes and the duties of a brighter day\"). In short, \"[h]ome and family bore the major responsibility for the moral training of children and thus, by implication, for the moral health of the nation.\" MacLeod 29; see also Introduction, in Marten 6; Reinier, p. xi; Smith, Autonomy and Affection: Parents and Children in Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake Families, in Growing up in America 54 (N. Hiner & J. Hawes eds. 1985).\n\nThis conception of parental rights and duties was exemplified by Thomas Jefferson's approach to raising children. He wrote letters to his daughters constantly and often gave specific instructions about what the children should do. See, e.g., Letter to Martha Jefferson (Nov. 28, 1783), in S. Randolph, The Domestic Life of Thomas Jefferson 44 (1939) (dictating her daily schedule of music, dancing, drawing, and studying); Letter to Martha Jefferson (Dec. 22, 1783), in id., at 45-46 (\"I do not wish you to be gaily clothed at this time of life . . . . [A]bove all things and at all times let your clothes be neat, whole, and properly put on\"). Jefferson expected his daughter, Martha, to write \"by every post\" and instructed her, \"Inform me what books you read [and] what tunes you learn.\" Letter (Nov. 28, 1783), in id., at 44. He took the same approach with his nephew, Peter Carr, after Carr's father died. See Letter (Aug. 19, 1785), in 8 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 405-408 (J. Boyd ed.1953) (detailing a course of reading and exercise, and asking for monthly progress reports describing \"in what manner you employ every hour in the day\"); see also 3 Dictionary of Virginia Biography 29 (2006).\n\nJefferson's rigorous management of his charges was not uncommon. \"[M]uch evidence indicates that mothers and fathers both believed in giving their children a strict upbringing, enforcing obedience to their commands and stressing continued subjection to the parental will.\" Norton 96. Two parenting books published in the 1830's gave prototypical advice. In The Mother's Book, Lydia Child advised that \"[t]he first and most important step in management is, that whatever a mother says, always must be done.\" Child 26. John Abbott, the author of The Mother at Home, likewise advised that \"[o]bedience is absolutely essential to proper family government.\" Abbott 18. Echoing Locke, Abbott warned that parents who indulged a child's \"foolish and unreasonable wishes\" would doom that child to be indulgent in adulthood. Id., at 16.\n\nThe concept of total parental control over children's lives extended into the schools. \"The government both of families and schools should be absolute,\" declared Noah Webster. Rudolph 57-58. Dr. Benjamin Rush concurred: \"In the education of youth, let the authority of our masters be as absolute as possible.\" Id., at 16. Through the doctrine of in loco parentis, teachers assumed the \"`sacred dut[y] of parents . . . to train up and qualify their children'\" and exercised the same authority \"`to command obedience, to control stubbornness, to quicken diligence, and to reform bad habits.'\" Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 413-414, 127 S.Ct. 2618, 168 L.Ed.2d 290 (2007) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (quoting State v. Pendergrass, 19 N.C. 365, 365-366 (1837)); see also Wishy 73. Thus, the quality of teachers and schools had to \"be watched with the most scrupulous attention.\" Webster, in Rudolph 64.\n\nFor their part, children were expected to be dutiful and obedient. Mintz & Kellogg 53; Wishy 31; cf. J. Kett, Rites of Passage 45 (1977). Schoolbooks instructed children to do so and frequently featured vignettes illustrating the consequences of disobedience. See Adams, \"Pictures of the Vicious ultimately overcome by misery and shame\": The Cultural Work of Early National Schoolbooks (hereinafter Adams), in Marten 156. One oft-related example was the hangings of 19 alleged witches in 1692, which, the schoolbooks noted, likely began with false complaints by two young girls. See J. Morse, The American Geography 191 (1789); see also Adams, in Marten 164.\n\nAn entire genre of books, \"loosely termed `advice to youth,'\" taught similar lessons well into the 1800's. J. Demos, Circles and Lines: The Shape of Life in Early America 73 (2004); cf. Wishy 54. \"Next to your duty to God,\" advised one book, \"is your duty to your parents\" even if the child did not \"understand the reason of their commands.\" L. Sigourney, The Girl's Reading Book 44 (14th ed. 1843); see also Filial Duty Recommended and Enforced, Introduction, p. iii (c. 1798); The Parent's Present 44 (3d ed. 1841). \"Disobedience is generally punished in some way or other,\" warned another, \"and often very severely.\" S. Goodrich, Peter Parley's Book of Fables 43 (1836); see also The Country School-House 27 (1848) (\"[T]he number of children who die from the effects of disobedience to their parents is very large\").4Society's concern with children's development extended to the books they read. \"Vice always spreads by being published,\" Noah Webster observed. Rudolph 62. \"[Y]oung people are taught many vices by fiction, books, or public exhibitions, vices which they never would have known had they never read such books or attended such public places.\" Ibid.; see also Cardell, p. xii (cautioning parents that \"[t]he first reading lessons for children have an extensive influence on the acquisitions and habits of future years\"); Youth's Companion 1 (\"[T]he capacities of children, and the peculiar situation and duties of youth, require select and appropriate reading\"). Prominent children's authors harshly criticized  fairy tales and the use of anthropomorphic animals. See, e.g., S. Goodrich, 2 Recollections of a Lifetime 320, n.* (1856) (describing fairy tales as \"calculated to familiarize the mind with things shocking and monstrous; to cultivate a taste for tales of bloodshed and violence; to teach the young to use coarse language, and cherish vulgar ideas; . . . and to fill [the youthful mind] with the horrors of a debased and debauched fancy\"); 1 id., at 167 (recalling that children's books were \"full of nonsense\" and \"lies\"); Cardell, p. xiv (\"The fancy of converting inferior animals into `teachers of children,' has been carried to ridiculous extravagance\"); see also MacDonald 83, 103 (noting that fables and works of fantasy were not popular in America in the 1700's).\n\nAdults carefully controlled what they published for children. Stories written for children were dedicated to moral instruction and were relatively austere, lacking details that might titillate children's minds. See MacLeod 24-25, 42-48; see also id., at 42 (\"The authors of juvenile fiction imposed the constraints upon themselves in the name of duty, and for the sake of giving children what they thought children should have, although they were often well aware that children might prefer more exciting fare\"); Francis, American Children's Literature, 1646-1880, in American Childhood 208-209 (J. Hawes & N. Hiner eds. 1985). John Newbery, the publisher often credited with creating the genre of children's literature, removed traditional folk characters, like Tom Thumb, from their original stories and placed them in new morality tales in which good children were rewarded and disobedient children punished. Reinier 12.\n\nParents had total authority over what their children read. See A. MacLeod, American Childhood 177 (1994) (\"Ideally, if not always actually, nineteenth-century parents regulated their children's lives fully, certainly including their reading\"). Lydia Child put it bluntly in The Mother's Book: \"Children . . . should not read anything without a mother's knowledge and sanction; this is particularly necessary between the ages of twelve and sixteen.\" Child 92; see also id., at 143 (\"[P]arents, or some guardian friends, should carefully examine every volume they put into the hands of young people\"); E. Monaghan, Learning to Read and Write in Colonial America 337 (2005) (reviewing a 12-year-old girl's journal from the early 1770's and noting that the child's aunts monitored and guided her reading).5The law at the time reflected the founding generation's understanding of parent-child relations. According to Sir William Blackstone, parents were responsible for maintaining, protecting, and education their children, and therefore had \"power\" over their children. 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 434, 440 (1765); cf. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 712, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) (Blackstone's Commentaries was \"a primary legal authority for 18th- and 19th-century American lawyers\"). Chancellor James Kent agreed. 2 Commentaries on American Law *189-*207. The law entitled parents to \"the custody of their [children],\" \"the value of th[e] [children's] labor and services,\" and the \"right to the exercise of such discipline as may be requisite for the discharge of their sacred trust.\" Id., at *193, *203. Children, in turn, were charged with \"obedience and assistance during their own minority, and gratitude and reverance during the rest of their lives.\" Id., at *207.\n\nThus, in case after case, courts made clear that parents had a right to the child's labor and services until the child reached majority. In 1810, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts explained, \"There is no question but that a father, who is entitled to the services of his minor son, and for whom he is obliged to provide, may, at the common law, assign those services to others, for a consideration to enure to himself.\" Day v. Everett, 7 Mass. 145, 147; see also Benson v. Remington, 2 Mass. 113, 115 (1806) (opinion of Parsons, C.J.) (\"The law is very well settled, that parents are under obligations to support their children, and that they are entitled to their earnings\"). Similarly, the Supreme Court of Judicature of New Hampshire noted that the right of parents to recover for the services of their child, while a minor, \"cannot be contested.\" Gale v. Parrot, 1 N.H. 28, 29 (1817). And parents could bring tort suits against those who knowingly enticed a minor away from them. See, e.g., Kirkpatrick v. Lockhart, 2 Brev. 276, 1809 WL 295 (S.C. Constitutional Ct. 1809); Jones v. Tevis, 14 Ky. 25, 4 Litt. 25 (1823).\n\nRelatedly, boys could not enlist in the military without parental consent. Many of those who did so during the Revolutionary War found, afterwards, that their fathers were entitled to their military wages. See Cox, Boy Soldiers of the American Revolution, in Marten 21-24. And after the war, minors who enlisted without parental consent in violation of federal law could find themselves returned home on writs of habeas corpus issued at their parents' request. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 24 F. Cas. 813 (No. 14,449) (CC Tenn. 1812); Commonwealth v. Callan, 6 Binn. 255 (Pa.1814) (per curiam).\n\nLaws also set age limits restricting marriage without parental consent. For example, from 1730 until at least 1849, Pennsylvania law required parental consent for the marriage of anyone under the age of 21. See 4 Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania 153 (J. Mitchell & H. Flanders eds. 1897) (hereinafter Pa. Stats. at Large); General Laws of Pennsylvania 82-83 (J. Dunlop 2d ed. 1849) (including the 1730 marriage law with no amendments); see also Perpetual Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 253 (1788), in The First Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (J. Cushing ed.1981). In general, \"[p]ost-Revolutionary marriage law assumed that below a certain age, children could . . . no[t] intellectually understand its significance.\" Grossberg 105.\n\nIndeed, the law imposed age limits on all manner of activities that required judgment and reason. Children could not vote, could not serve on juries, and generally could not be witnesses in criminal cases unless they were older than 14. See Brewer 43, 145, 148, 159. Nor could they swear loyalty to a State. See, e.g., 9 Pa. Stats. at Large 111 (1903 ed.). Early federal laws granting aliens the ability to become citizens provided that those under 21 were deemed citizens if their fathers chose to naturalize. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 26, 1790, 1 Stat. 104; Act of Jan. 29, 1795, ch. 20, 1 Stat. 415.CThe history clearly shows a founding generation that believed parents to have complete authority over their minor children and expected parents to direct the development of those children. The Puritan tradition in New England laid the foundation of American parental authority and duty. See MacDonald 6 (\"The Puritans are virtually the inventors of the family as we know it today\"). In the decades leading up to and following the Revolution, the conception of the child's mind evolved but the duty and authority of parents remained. Indeed, society paid closer attention to potential influences on children than before. See Mintz 72 (\"By weakening  earlier forms of patriarchal authority, the Revolution enhanced the importance of childrearing and education in ensuring social stability\"). Teachers and schools came under scrutiny, and children's reading material was carefully supervised. Laws reflected these concerns and often supported parental authority with the coercive power of the state.IIAIn light of this history, the Framers could not possibly have understood \"the freedom of speech\" to include an unqualified right to speak to minors. Specifically, I am sure that the founding generation would not have understood \"the freedom of speech\" to include a right to speak to children without going through their parents. As a consequence, I do not believe that laws limiting such speech—for example, by requiring parental consent to speak to a minor—\"abridg[e] the freedom of speech\" within the original meaning of the First Amendment.\n\nWe have recently noted that this Court does not have \"freewheeling authority to declare new categories of speech outside the scope of the First Amendment.\" Stevens, 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1586. But we also recognized that there may be \"some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected [and] have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.\" Ibid. In my opinion, the historical evidence here plainly reveals one such category.[2]BAdmittedly, the original public understanding of a constitutional provision does not always comport with modern sensibilities. See Morse, 551 U.S., at 419, 127 S.Ct. 2618 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (treating students \"as though it were still the 19th century would find little support today\"). It may also be inconsistent with precedent. See McDonald, 561 U.S., at ___-___, 130 S.Ct., at 3084-3086 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (rejecting the Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 21 L.Ed. 394 (1873), as inconsistent with the original public meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment).\n\nThis, however, is not such a case. Although much has changed in this country since the Revolution, the notion that parents have authority over their children and that the law can support that authority persists today. For example, at least some States make it a crime to lure or entice a minor away from the minor's parent. See, e.g., Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 272(b)(1) (West 2008); Fla. Stat.  § 787.03 (2010). Every State in the Union still establishes a minimum age for marriage without parental or judicial consent. Cf. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 558, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (Appendix D to opinion of Court) (2005). Individuals less than 18 years old cannot enlist in the military without parental consent. 10 U.S.C. § 505(a). And minors remain subject to curfew laws across the country, see Brief for Louisiana et al. as Amici Curiae 16, and cannot unilaterally consent to most medical procedures, id., at 15.\n\nMoreover, there are many things minors today cannot do at all, whether they have parental consent or not. State laws set minimum ages for voting and jury duty. See Roper, supra, at 581-585, 125 S.Ct. 1183 (Appendixes B and C to opinion of Court). In California (the State at issue here), minors cannot drive for hire or drive a school bus, Cal. Veh.Code Ann. §§ 12515, 12516 (West 2010), purchase tobacco, Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 308(b) (West 2008), play bingo for money, § 326.5(e), or execute a will, Cal. Probate Code Ann. § 6220 (West 2009).\n\nMy understanding of \"the freedom of speech\" is also consistent with this Court's precedents. To be sure, the Court has held that children are entitled to the protection of the First Amendment, see, e.g., Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212-213, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975), and the government may not unilaterally dictate what children can say or hear, see id., at 213-214, 95 S.Ct. 2268; Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 511, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). But this Court has never held, until today, that \"the freedom of speech\" includes a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors' parents. To the contrary, \"[i]t is well settled that a State or municipality can adopt more stringent controls on communicative materials available to youths than on those available to adults.\" Erznoznik, supra, at 212, 95 S.Ct. 2268; cf. post, at 2762-2763 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\n\nThe Court's constitutional jurisprudence \"historically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children.\" Parham v. J. R., 442 U.S. 584, 602, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979). Under that case law, \"legislature[s][can] properly conclude that parents and others, teachers for example, who have . . . primary responsibility for children's well-being are entitled to the support of laws designed to aid discharge of that responsibility.\" Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 639, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968); see also Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 635, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979) (opinion of Powell, J.) (\"[T]he State is entitled to adjust its legal system to account for children's vulnerability and their needs for concern, . . . sympathy, and. . . paternal attention\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). This is because \"the tradition of parental authority is not inconsistent with our tradition of individual liberty; rather, the former is one of the basic presuppositions of the latter.\" Id., at 638, 99 S.Ct. 3035; id., at 638-639, 99 S.Ct. 3035 (\"Legal restrictions on minors, especially those supportive of the parental role, may be important to the child's chances for the full growth and maturity that make eventual participation in a free society meaningful and rewarding\").IIIThe California law at issue here prohibits the sale or rental of \"violent video game[s]\" to minors, defined as anyone \"under 18 years of age.\" Cal. Civ.Code Ann. §§ 1746.1(a), 1746 (West 2009). A violation of the law is punishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. § 1746.3. Critically, the law does not prohibit adults from buying or renting violent video games for a minor or prohibit minors from playing such games. Cf. ante, at 2747 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment); post, at 2766-2767 (BREYER, J., dissenting). The law also does not restrict a \"minor's parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian\" from selling or renting him a violent video game. § 1746.1(c).\n\nRespondents, associations of companies in the video game industry, brought a preenforcement challenge to California's law, claiming that on its face the law violates the free speech rights of their members. The Court holds that video games are speech for purposes of the First Amendment and finds the statute facially unconstitutional. See ante, at 2742-2743, 2747-2751. I disagree.\n\nUnder any of this Court's standards for a facial First Amendment challenge, this one must fail. The video game associations cannot show \"that no set of circumstances exists under which [the law] would be valid,\" \"that the statute lacks any plainly legitimate sweep,\" or that \"a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.\" Stevens, 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1587 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even assuming that video games are speech, in most applications the California law does not implicate the First Amendment. All that the law does is prohibit the direct sale or rental of a violent video game to a minor by someone other than the minor's parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian. Where a minor has a parent or guardian, as is usually true, the law does not prevent that minor from obtaining a violent video game with his parent's or guardian's help. In the typical case, the only speech affected is speech that bypasses a minor's parent or guardian. Because such speech does not fall within \"the freedom of speech\" as originally understood, California's law does not ordinarily implicate the First Amendment and is not facially unconstitutional.[3]\n\n* * *\n\n\"The freedom of speech,\" as originally understood, does not include a right to speak to minors without going through the minors' parents or guardians. Therefore, I cannot agree that the statute at issue is facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment.\n\nI respectfully dissent.Justice BREYER, dissenting.California imposes a civil fine of up to $1,000 upon any person who distributes a violent video game in California without labeling it \"18,\" or who sells or rents a labeled violent video game to a person under the age of 18. Representatives of the video game and software industries, claiming that the statute violates the First Amendment on its face, seek an injunction against its enforcement. Applying traditional First Amendment analysis, I would uphold the statute as constitutional on its face and would consequently reject the industries' facial challenge.IACalifornia's statute defines a violent video game as: A game in which a player \"kill[s], maim[s], dismember[s], or sexually assault[s] an image of a human being,\"\n\nand[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find [the game] appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors,\"and[the game] is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors,\"andthe game, as a whole, ... lack[s] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\" Cal. Civ.Code Ann. § 1746(d)(1) (West 2009).The statute in effect forbids the sale of such a game to minors unless they are accompanied by a parent; it requires the makers of the game to affix a label identifying it as a game suitable only for those aged 18 and over; it exempts retailers from liability unless such a label is properly affixed to the game; and it imposes a civil fine of up to $1,000 upon a violator. See §§ 1746.1-1746.3.BA facial challenge to this statute based on the First Amendment can succeed only if \"a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.\" United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. ___, ___, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 1587, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, it is more difficult to mount a facial First Amendment attack on a statute that seeks to regulate activity that involves action as well as speech. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 614-615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). Hence, I shall focus here upon an area within which I believe the State can legitimately apply its statute, namely sales to minors under the age of 17 (the age cutoff used by the industry's own ratings system), of highly realistic violent video games, which a reasonable game maker would know meet the Act's criteria. That area lies at the heart of the statute. I shall assume that the number of instances in which the State will enforce the statute within that area is comparatively large, and that the number outside that area (for example, sales to 17-year-olds) is comparatively small. And the activity the statute regulates combines speech with action (a virtual form of target practice).CIn determining whether the statute is unconstitutional, I would apply both this Court's \"vagueness\" precedents and a strict form of First Amendment scrutiny. In doing so, the special First Amendment category I find relevant is not (as the Court claims) the category of \"depictions of violence,\" ante, at 2736, but rather the category of \"protection of children.\" This Court has held that the \"power of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults.\" Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 170, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944). And the \"`regulatio[n] of communication addressed to [children] need not conform to the requirements of the [F]irst [A]mendment in the same way as those applicable to adults.'\" Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 638, n. 6, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968) (quoting Emerson, Toward a General Theory of the First Amendment, 72 Yale L.J. 877, 939 (1963)).\n\nThe majority's claim that the California statute, if upheld, would create a \"new categor[y] of unprotected speech,\" ante, at 2734, 2735, is overstated. No one here argues that depictions of violence, even extreme violence, automatically fall outside the First Amendment's protective scope as, for example, do obscenity and  depictions of child pornography. We properly speak of categories of expression that lack protection when, like \"child pornography,\" the category is broad, when it applies automatically, and when the State can prohibit everyone, including adults, from obtaining access to the material within it. But where, as here, careful analysis must precede a narrower judicial conclusion (say, denying protection to a shout of \"fire\" in a crowded theater, or to an effort to teach a terrorist group how to peacefully petition the United Nations), we do not normally describe the result as creating a \"new category of unprotected speech.\" See Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919); Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2705, 177 L.Ed.2d 355 (2010).\n\nThus, in Stevens, after rejecting the claim that all depictions of animal cruelty (a category) fall outside the First Amendment's protective scope, we went on to decide whether the particular statute at issue violates the First Amendment under traditional standards; and we held that, because the statute was overly broad, it was invalid. Similarly, here the issue is whether, applying traditional First Amendment standards, this statute does, or does not, pass muster.IIIn my view, California's statute provides \"fair notice of what is prohibited,\" and consequently it is not impermissibly vague. United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008). Ginsberg explains why that is so. The Court there considered a New York law that forbade the sale to minors of apicture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion picture film, or similar visual representation or image of a person or portion of the human body which depicts nudity ...,\"thatpredominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors,\"andis patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors,\"andis utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.\" 390 U.S., at 646-647, 88 S.Ct. 1274.This Court upheld the New York statute in Ginsberg (which is sometimes unfortunately confused with a very different, earlier case, Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S.Ct. 942, 16 L.Ed.2d 31 (1966)). The five-Justice majority, in an opinion written by Justice Brennan, wrote that the statute was sufficiently clear. 390 U.S., at 643-645, 88 S.Ct. 1274. No Member of the Court voiced any vagueness objection. See id., at 648-650, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Stewart, J., concurring in result); id., at 650-671, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Douglas, J., joined by Black, J., dissenting); id., at 671-675, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Fortas, J., dissenting).\n\nComparing the language of California's statute (set forth supra, at 2732-2733) with the language of New York's statute (set forth immediately above), it is difficult to find any vagueness-related difference. Why are the words \"kill,\" \"maim,\" and \"dismember\" any more difficult to understand than the word \"nudity?\" Justice ALITO objects that these words do \"not perform the narrowing function\" that this Court has required in adult obscenity cases, where statutes can only cover \"`hard core'\" depictions. Ante, at 2744-2745 (opinion concurring in judgment). But the relevant comparison is not to adult obscenity cases but to Ginsberg, which dealt with \"nudity,\" a category no more \"narrow\" than killing and maiming. And in any event, narrowness and vagueness do not necessarily have anything to do with one another. All that is required for vagueness purposes is that the terms \"kill,\" \"maim,\" and \"dismember\" give fair notice as to what they cover, which they do.\n\nThe remainder of California's definition copies, almost word for word, the language this Court used in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), in permitting a total ban on material that satisfied its definition (one enforced with criminal penalties). The California law's reliance on \"community standards\" adheres to Miller, and in Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 57-58, 109 S.Ct. 916, 103 L.Ed.2d 34 (1989), this Court specifically upheld the use of Miller' s language against charges of vagueness. California only departed from the Miller formulation in two significant respects: It substituted the word \"deviant\" for the words \"prurient\" and \"shameful,\" and it three times added the words \"for minors.\" The word \"deviant\" differs from \"prurient\" and \"shameful,\" but it would seem no less suited to defining and narrowing the reach of the statute. And the addition of \"for minors\" to a version of the Miller standard was approved in Ginsberg, 390 U.S., at 643, 88 S.Ct. 1274, even though the New York law \"dr[ew] no distinction between young children and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority,\" ante, at 2746 (opinion of ALITO, J.).\n\nBoth the Miller standard and the law upheld in Ginsberg lack perfect clarity. But that fact reflects the difficulty of the Court's long search for words capable of protecting expression without depriving the State of a legitimate constitutional power to regulate. As is well known, at one point Justice Stewart thought he could do no better in defining obscenity than, \"I know it when I see it.\" Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 197, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964) (concurring opinion). And Justice Douglas dissented from Miller's standard, which he thought was still too vague. 413 U.S., at 39-40, 93 S.Ct. 2607. Ultimately, however, this Court accepted the \"community standards\" tests used in Miller and Ginsberg. They reflect the fact that sometimes, even when a precise standard proves elusive, it is easy enough to identify instances that fall within a legitimate regulation. And they seek to draw a line, which, while favoring free expression, will nonetheless permit a legislature to find the words necessary to accomplish a legitimate constitutional objective. Cf. Williams, supra, at 304, 128 S.Ct. 1830 (the Constitution does not always require \"`perfect clarity and precise guidance,'\" even when \"`expressive activity'\" is involved).\n\nWhat, then, is the difference between Ginsberg and Miller on the one hand and the California law on the other? It will often be easy to pick out cases at which California's statute directly aims, involving, say, a character who shoots out a police officer's knee, douses him with gasoline, lights him on fire, urinates on his burning body, and finally kills him with a gunshot to the head. (Footage of one such game sequence has been submitted in the record.) See also ante, at 2749-2750 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). As in Miller and Ginsberg, the California law clearly protects even the most violent games that possess serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. § 1746(d)(1)(A)(iii). And it is easier here than in Miller or Ginsberg to separate the sheep from the goats at the statute's border. That is because here the industry itself has promulgated standards and created a review process, in which adults who \"typically have experience with children\" assess what games are inappropriate for minors. See Entertainment Software Rating Board, Rating Process, online at http:// www.esrb.org/ratings/ & ratings_ process.jsp (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).\n\nThere is, of course, one obvious difference: The Ginsberg statute concerned depictions of \"nudity,\" while California's statute concerns extremely violent video games. But for purposes of vagueness, why should that matter? Justice ALITO argues that the Miller standard sufficed because there are \"certain generally accepted norms concerning expression related to sex,\" whereas there are no similarly \"accepted standards regarding the suitability of violent entertainment.\" Ante, at 2745. But there is no evidence that is so. The Court relied on \"community standards\" in Miller precisely because of the difficulty of articulating \"accepted norms\" about depictions of sex. I can find no difference—historical or otherwise—that is relevant to the vagueness question. Indeed, the majority's examples of literary descriptions of violence, on which Justice ALITO relies, do not show anything relevant at all.\n\nAfter all, one can find in literature as many (if not more) descriptions of physical love as descriptions of violence. Indeed, sex \"has been a theme in art and literature throughout the ages.\" Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 246, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002). For every Homer, there is a Titian. For every Dante, there is an Ovid. And for all the teenagers who have read the original versions of Grimm's Fairy Tales, I suspect there are those who know the story of Lady Godiva.\n\nThus, I can find no meaningful vagueness-related differences between California's law and the New York law upheld in Ginsberg. And if there remain any vagueness problems, the state courts can cure them through interpretation. See Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 216, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975) (\"[S]tate statute should not be deemed facially invalid unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts\"). Cf. Ginsberg, supra, at 644, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (relying on the fact that New York Court of Appeals would read a knowledge requirement into the statute); Berry v. Santa Barbara, 40 Cal.App.4th 1075, 1088-1089, 47 Cal.Rptr.2d 661, 669 (1995) (reading a knowledge requirement into a statute). Consequently, for purposes of this facial challenge, I would not find the statute unconstitutionally vague.IIIVideo games combine physical action with expression. Were physical activity to predominate in a game, government could appropriately intervene, say by requiring parents to accompany children when playing a game involving actual target practice, or restricting the sale of toys presenting physical dangers to children. See generally Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, 122 Stat. 3016 (\"Title I— Children's Product Safety\"). But because video games also embody important expressive and artistic elements, I agree with the Court that the First Amendment significantly limits the State's power to regulate. And I would determine whether the State has exceeded those limits by applying a strict standard of review.\n\nLike the majority, I believe that the California law must be \"narrowly tailored\" to further a \"compelling interest,\" without there being a \"less restrictive\" alternative that would be \"at least as effective.\" Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 874, 875, 879, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997). I would not apply this strict standard \"mechanically.\" United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 841, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000) (BREYER, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and SCALIA, JJ., dissenting). Rather, in applying it, I would evaluate the degree to which the statute injures speech-related interests, the nature of the potentially-justifying \"compelling interests,\" the degree to which the statute furthers that interest, the nature and effectiveness of possible alternatives, and, in light of this evaluation, whether, overall, \"the statute works speech-related harm ... out of proportion to the benefits that the statute seeks to provide.\" Ibid. See also Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 210, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992) (plurality opinion) (applying strict scrutiny and finding relevant the lack of a \"significant impingement\" on speech).\n\nFirst Amendment standards applied in this way are difficult but not impossible to satisfy. Applying \"strict scrutiny\" the Court has upheld restrictions on speech that, for example, ban the teaching of peaceful dispute resolution to a group on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations, Holder, 561 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 2723-3730; but cf. id., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 2731 (BREYER, J., dissenting), and limit speech near polling places, Burson, supra, at 210-211, 112 S.Ct. 1846 (plurality opinion). And applying less clearly defined but still rigorous standards, the Court has allowed States to require disclosure of petition signers, Doe v. Reed, 561 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2811, 177 L.Ed.2d 493 (2010), and to impose campaign contribution limits that were \"`closely drawn' to match a `sufficiently important interest,'\" Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 387-388, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000).\n\nMoreover, although the Court did not specify the \"level of scrutiny\" it applied in Ginsberg, we have subsequently described that case as finding a \"compelling interest\" in protecting children from harm sufficient to justify limitations on speech. See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989). Since the Court in Ginsberg specified that the statute's prohibition applied to material that was not obscene, 390 U.S., at 634, 88 S.Ct. 1274, I cannot dismiss Ginsberg on the ground that it concerned obscenity. But cf. ante, at 2735 (majority opinion). Nor need I depend upon the fact that the Court in Ginsberg insisted only that the legislature have a \"rational\" basis for finding the depictions there at issue harmful to children. 390 U.S., at 639, 88 S.Ct. 1274. For in this case, California has substantiated its claim of harm with considerably stronger evidence.ACalifornia's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression. The statute prevents no one from playing a video game, it prevents no adult from buying a video game, and it prevents no child or adolescent from obtaining a game provided a parent is willing to help. § 1746.1(c). All it prevents is a child or adolescent from buying, without a parent's assistance, a gruesomely violent video game of a kind that the industry itself tells us it wants to keep out of the hands of those under the age of 17. See Brief for Respondents 8.\n\nNor is the statute, if upheld, likely to create a precedent that would adversely affect other media, say films, or videos, or books. A typical video game involves a significant amount of physical activity. See ante, at 2748-2749 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (citing examples of the increasing interactivity of video game controllers). And pushing buttons that achieve an interactive, virtual form of target practice (using images of human beings as targets), while containing an expressive component, is not just like watching a typical movie. See infra, at 2768-2769.BThe interest that California advances in support of the statute is compelling. As this Court has previously described that interest, it consists of both (1) the \"basic\" parental claim \"to authority in their own household to direct the rearing of their children,\" which makes it proper to enact \"laws designed to aid discharge of [parental] responsibility,\" and (2) the State's \"independent interest in the well-being of its youth.\" Ginsberg, 390 U.S., at 639-640, 88 S.Ct. 1274. Cf. id., at 639, n. 7, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (\"`[O]ne can well distinguish laws which do not impose a morality on children, but which support the right of parents to deal with the morals of their children as they see fit'\" (quoting Henkin, Morals and the Constitution: The Sin of Obscenity, 63 Colum. L.Rev. 391, 413, n. 68 (1963))). And where these interests work in tandem, it is not fatally \"underinclusive\" for a State to advance its interests in protecting children against the special harms present in an interactive video game medium through a default rule that still allows parents to provide their children with what their parents wish.\n\nBoth interests are present here. As to the need to help parents guide their children, the Court noted in 1968 that \"`parental control or guidance cannot always be provided.'\" 390 U.S., at 640, 88 S.Ct. 1274. Today, 5.3 million grade-school-age children of working parents are routinely home alone. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, Who's Minding the Kids? Child Care Arrangements: Spring 2005/Summer 2006, p. 12 (2010), online at http:// www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p70-121.pdf. Thus, it has, if anything, become more important to supplement parents' authority to guide their children's development.\n\nAs to the State's independent interest, we have pointed out that juveniles are more likely to show a \"`lack of maturity'\" and are \"more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures,\" and that their \"character ... is not as well formed as that of an adult.\" Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 569-570, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). And we have therefore recognized \"a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors.\" Sable Communications, supra, at 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829.\n\nAt the same time, there is considerable evidence that California's statute significantly furthers this compelling interest. That is, in part, because video games are excellent teaching tools. Learning a practical task often means developing habits, becoming accustomed to performing the task, and receiving positive reinforcement when performing that task well. Video games can help develop habits, accustom the player to performance of the task, and reward the player for performing that task well. Why else would the Armed Forces incorporate video games into its training? See CNN, War Games: Military Training Goes High-Tech (Nov. 22, 2001), online at http://articles.cnn.com / 2001-11-2 / tech /2war.games_1_ictbill-swartout-real-world-training?_s=PM:TECH.\n\nWhen the military uses video games to help soldiers train for missions, it is using this medium for a beneficial purpose. But California argues that when the teaching features of video games are put to less desirable ends, harm can ensue. In particular, extremely violent games can harm children by rewarding them for being violently aggressive in play, and thereby often teaching them to be violently aggressive in life. And video games can cause more harm in this respect than can typically passive media, such as books or films or television programs.\n\nThere are many scientific studies that support California's views. Social scientists, for example, have found causal evidence that playing these games results in harm. Longitudinal studies, which measure changes over time, have found that increased exposure to violent video games causes an increase in aggression over the same period. See Möller & Krahe, Exposure to Violent Video Games and Aggression in German Adolescents: A Longitudinal Analysis, 35 Aggressive Behavior 75 (2009); Gentile & Gentile, Violent Video Games as Exemplary Teachers: A Conceptual Analysis, 37 J. Youth & Adolescence 127 (2008); Anderson et al., Longitudinal Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggression in Japan and the United States, 122 Pediatrics e1067 (2008); Wallenius & Punamuki, Digital Game Violence and Direct Aggression in Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study of the Roles of Sex, Age, and Parent-Child Communication, 29 J. Applied Developmental Psychology 286 (2008).\n\nExperimental studies in laboratories have found that subjects randomly assigned to play a violent video game subsequently displayed more characteristics of aggression than those who played nonviolent games. See, e.g., Anderson et al., Violent Video Games: Specific Effects of Violent Content on Aggressive Thoughts and Behavior, 36 Advances in Experimental Soc. Psychology 199 (2004).\n\nSurveys of 8th and 9th grade students have found a correlation between playing violent video games and aggression. See, e.g., Gentile, Lynch, Linder, & Walsh, The Effects of Violent Video Game Habits On Adolescent Hostility, Aggressive Behaviors, and School Performance, 27 J. Adolescence 5 (2004).\n\nCutting-edge neuroscience has shown that \"virtual violence in video game playing results in those neural patterns that are considered characteristic for aggressive cognition and behavior.\" Weber, Ritterfeld, & Mathiak, Does Playing Violent Video Games Induce Aggression? Empirical Evidence of a Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study, 8 Media Psychology 39, 51 (2006).\n\nAnd \"meta-analyses,\" i.e., studies of all the studies, have concluded that exposure to violent video games \"was positively associated with aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect,\" and that \"playing violent video games is a causal risk factor for long-term harmful outcomes.\" Anderson et al., Violent Video Game Effects on Aggression, Empathy, and Prosocial Behavior in Eastern and Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review, 136 Psychological Bulletin 151, 167, 169 (2010) (emphasis added).\n\nSome of these studies take care to explain in a commonsense way why video games are potentially more harmful than, say, films or books or television. In essence, they say that the closer a child's behavior comes, not to watching, but to acting out horrific violence, the greater the potential psychological harm. See Bushman & Huesmann, Aggression, in 2 Handbook of Social Pscyhology 833, 851 (S. Fiske, D. Gilbert, & G. Lindzey eds., 5th ed.2010) (video games stimulate more aggression because \"[p]eople learn better when they are actively involved,\" players are \"more likely to identify with violent characters,\" and \"violent games directly reward violent behavior\"); Polman, de Castro, & van Aken, Experimental Study of the Differential Effects of Playing Versus Watching Violent Video Games on Children's Aggressive Behavior, 34 Aggressive Behavior 256 (2008) (finding greater aggression resulting from playing, as opposed to watching, a violent game); C. Anderson, D. Gentile, & K. Buckley, Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adolescents 136-137 (2007) (three studies finding greater effects from games as opposed to television). See also infra, at 2769-2770 (statements of expert public health associations agreeing that interactive games can be more harmful than \"passive\" media like television); ante, at 2748-2751 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment).\n\nExperts debate the conclusions of all these studies. Like many, perhaps most, studies of human behavior, each study has its critics, and some of those critics have produced studies of their own in which they reach different conclusions. (I list both sets of research in the appendixes.) I, like most judges, lack the social science expertise to say definitively who is right. But associations of public health professionals who do possess that expertise have reviewed many of these studies and found a significant risk that violent video games, when compared with more passive media, are particularly likely to cause children harm.\n\nEleven years ago, for example, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Psychiatric Association released a joint statement, which said:[O]ver 1000 studies ... point overwhelmingly to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children ... [and, though less research had been done at that time, preliminary studies indicated that] the impact of violent interactive entertainment (video games and other interactive media) on young people ... may be significantly more severe than that wrought by television, movies, or music.\" Joint Statement on the Impact of Entertainment Violence on Children (2000) (emphasis added), online at http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/jstmtevc.htm.Five years later, after more research had been done, the American Psychological Association adopted a resolution that said:[C]omprehensive analysis of violent interactive video game research suggests such exposure ... increases aggressive behavior, ... increases aggressive thoughts, ... increases angry feelings,... decreases helpful behavior, and ... increases physiological arousal.\" Resolution on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media (2005), online at http://ww.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/interactive-media.pdf.The Association added:[T]he practice, repetition, and rewards for acts of violence may be more conducive to increasing aggressive behavior among children and youth than passively watching violence on TV and in films.\" Ibid. (emphasis added).Four years after that, in 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement in significant part about interactive media. It said:Studies of these rapidly growing and ever-more-sophisticated types of media have indicated that the effects of child-initiated virtual violence may be even more profound than those of passive media such as television. In many games the child or teenager is `embedded' in the game and uses a `joystick' (handheld controller) that enhances both the experience and the aggressive feelings.\" Policy Statement—Media Violence, 124 Pediatrics 1495, 1498 (2009) (emphasis added).It added:Correlational and experimental studies have revealed that violent video games lead to increases in aggressive behavior and aggressive thinking and decreases in prosocial behavior. Recent longitudinal studies ... have revealed that in as little as 3 months, high exposure to violent video games increased physical aggression. Other recent longitudinal studies ... have revealed similar effects across 2 years.\" Ibid. (footnotes omitted).Unlike the majority, I would find sufficient grounds in these studies and expert opinions for this Court to defer to an elected legislature's conclusion that the video games in question are particularly likely to harm children. This Court has always thought it owed an elected legislature some degree of deference in respect to legislative facts of this kind, particularly when they involve technical matters that are beyond our competence, and even in First Amendment cases. See Holder, 561 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 2726-2727 (deferring, while applying strict scrutiny, to the Government's national security judgments); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. 180, 195-196, 117 S.Ct. 1174, 137 L.Ed.2d 369 (1997) (deferring, while applying intermediate scrutiny, to the Government's technological judgments). The majority, in reaching its own, opposite conclusion about the validity of the relevant studies, grants the legislature no deference at all. Compare ante, at 2738-2739 (stating that the studies do not provide evidence that violent video games \"cause\" harm (emphasis deleted)), with supra, at 2767-2768 (citing longitudinal studies finding causation).CI can find no \"less restrictive\" alternative to California's law that would be \"at least as effective.\" See Reno, 521 U.S., at 874, 117 S.Ct. 2329. The majority points to a voluntary alternative: The industry tries to prevent those under 17 from buying extremely violent games by labeling those games with an \"M\" (Mature) and encouraging retailers to restrict their sales to those 17 and older. See ante, at 2740-2741. But this voluntary system has serious enforcement gaps. When California enacted its law, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) study had found that nearly 70% of unaccompanied 13- to 16-year-olds were able to buy M-rated video games. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 27 (2004), online at http://www. ftc.gov/os/2004/ 07/040708kidsviolencerpt. pdf. Subsequently the voluntary program has become more effective. But as of the FTC's most recent update to Congress, 20% of those under 17 are still able to buy M-rated video games, and, breaking down sales by store, one finds that this number rises to nearly 50% in the case of one large national chain. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 28 (2009), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/12/ P994511violententertainment.pdf. And the industry could easily revert back to the substantial noncompliance that existed in 2004, particularly after today's broad ruling reduces the industry's incentive to police itself.\n\nIVThe upshot is that California's statute, as applied to its heartland of applications (i.e., buyers under 17; extremely violent, realistic video games), imposes a restriction on speech that is modest at most. That restriction is justified by a compelling interest (supplementing parents' efforts to prevent their children from purchasing potentially harmful violent, interactive material). And there is no equally effective, less restrictive alternative. California's statute is consequently constitutional on its face—though litigants remain free to challenge the statute as applied in particular instances, including any effort by the State to apply it to minors aged 17.\n\nI add that the majority's different conclusion creates a serious anomaly in First Amendment law. Ginsberg makes clear that a State can prohibit the sale to minors of depictions of nudity; today the Court makes clear that a State cannot prohibit the sale to minors of the most violent interactive video games. But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13-year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her? What kind of First Amendment would permit the government to protect children by restricting sales of that extremely violent video game only when the woman—bound, gagged, tortured, and killed—is also topless?\n\nThis anomaly is not compelled by the First Amendment. It disappears once one recognizes that extreme violence, where interactive, and without literary, artistic, or similar justification, can prove at least as, if not more, harmful to children as photographs of nudity. And the record here is more than adequate to support such a view. That is why I believe that Ginsberg controls the outcome here a fortiori. And it is why I believe California's law is constitutional on its face.\n\nThis case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education. Our Constitution cannot succeed in securing the liberties it seeks to protect unless we can raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work. Education, however, is about choices. Sometimes, children need to learn by making choices for themselves. Other times, choices are made for children—by their parents, by their teachers, and by the people acting democratically through their governments. In my view, the First Amendment does not disable government from helping parents make such a choice here—a choice not to have their children buy extremely violent, interactive video games, which they more than reasonably fear pose only the risk of harm to those children.\n\nFor these reasons, I respectfully dissent.FOOTNOTES[1] Justice ALITO distinguishes Stevens on several grounds that seem to us ill founded. He suggests, post, at 2747 (opinion concurring in judgment), that Stevens did not apply strict scrutiny. If that is so (and we doubt it), it would make this an a fortiori case. He says, post, at 2746-2747, 2747, that the California Act punishes the sale or rental rather than the \"creation\" or \"possession\" of violent depictions. That distinction appears nowhere in Stevens itself, and for good reason: It would make permissible the prohibition of printing or selling books—though not the writing of them. Whether government regulation applies to creating, distributing, or consuming speech makes no difference. And finally, Justice ALITO points out, post, at 2747, that Stevens \"left open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute\" would be constitutional. True, but entirely irrelevant. Stevens said, 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1592, that the \"crush-video\" statute at issue there might pass muster if it were limited to videos of acts of animal cruelty that violated the law where the acts were performed. There is no contention that any of the virtual characters depicted in the imaginative videos at issue here are criminally liable.\n\n[2] The statute in Ginsberg restricted the sale of certain depictions of \"nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sado-masochistic abuse,\" that were \"`[h]armful to minors.'\" A depiction was harmful to minors if it:\n\n\"(i) predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interests of minors, and\n\n\"(ii) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors, and\n\n\"(iii) is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.\" 390 U.S., at 646, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court) (quoting N.Y. Penal Law § 484-h(1)(f)).\n\n[3] Justice THOMAS ignores the holding of Erznoznik, and denies that persons under 18 have any constitutional right to speak or be spoken to without their parents' consent. He cites no case, state or federal, supporting this view, and to our knowledge there is none. Most of his dissent is devoted to the proposition that parents have traditionally had the power to control what their children hear and say. This is true enough. And it perhaps follows from this that the state has the power to enforce parental prohibitions—to require, for example, that the promoters of a rock concert exclude those minors whose parents have advised the promoters that their children are forbidden to attend. But it does not follow that the state has the power to prevent children from hearing or saying anything without their parents' prior consent. The latter would mean, for example, that it could be made criminal to admit persons under 18 to a political rally without their parents' prior written consent—even a political rally in support of laws against corporal punishment of children, or laws in favor of greater rights for minors. And what is good for First Amendment rights of speech must be good for First Amendment rights of religion as well: It could be made criminal to admit a person under 18 to church, or to give a person under 18 a religious tract, without his parents' prior consent. Our point is not, as Justice THOMAS believes, post, at 2759, n. 2, merely that such laws are \"undesirable.\" They are obviously an infringement upon the religious freedom of young people and those who wish to proselytize young people. Such laws do not enforce parental authority over children's speech and religion; they impose governmental authority, subject only to a parental veto. In the absence of any precedent for state control, uninvited by the parents, over a child's speech and religion (Justice THOMAS cites none), and in the absence of any justification for such control that would satisfy strict scrutiny, those laws must be unconstitutional. This argument is not, as Justice THOMAS asserts, \"circular,\" ibid. It is the absence of any historical warrant or compelling justification for such restrictions, not our ipse dixit, that renders them invalid.\n\n[4] Justice ALITO accuses us of pronouncing that playing violent video games \"is not different in `kind'\" from reading violent literature. Post, at 2742. Well of course it is different in kind, but not in a way that causes the provision and viewing of violent video games, unlike the provision and reading of books, not to be expressive activity and hence not to enjoy First Amendment protection. Reading Dante is unquestionably more cultured and intellectually edifying than playing Mortal Kombat. But these cultural and intellectual differences are not constitutional ones. Crudely violent video games, tawdry TV shows, and cheap novels and magazines are no less forms of speech than The Divine Comedy, and restrictions upon them must survive strict scrutiny—a question to which we devote our attention in Part III, infra. Even if we can see in them \"nothing of any possible value to society . . ., they are as much entitled to the protection of free speech as the best of literature.\" Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 510, 68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840 (1948).\n\n[5] The crusade against comic books was led by a psychiatrist, Frederic Wertham, who told the Senate Judiciary Committee that \"as long as the crime comic books industry exists in its present forms there are no secure homes.\" Juvenile Delinquency (Comic Books): Hearings before the Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 84 (1954). Wertham's objections extended even to Superman comics, which he described as \"particularly injurious to the ethical development of children.\" Id., at 86. Wertham's crusade did convince the New York Legislature to pass a ban on the sale of certain comic books to minors, but it was vetoed by Governor Thomas Dewey on the ground that it was unconstitutional given our opinion in Winters, supra. See People v. Bookcase, Inc., 14 N.Y.2d 409, 412-413, 252 N.Y.S.2d 433, 201 N.E.2d 14, 15-16 (1964).\n\n[6] See Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger, 556 F.3d 950, 963-964 (C.A.9 2009); Interactive Digital Software Assn. v. St. Louis County, 329 F.3d 954 (C.A.8 2003); American Amusement Machine Assn. v. Kendrick, 244 F.3d 572, 578-579 (C.A.7 2001); Entertainment Software Assn. v. Foti, 451 F.Supp.2d 823, 832-833 (M.D.La.2006); Entertainment Software Assn. v. Hatch, 443 F.Supp.2d 1065, 1070 (Minn.2006), aff'd, 519 F.3d 768 (C.A.8 2008); Entertainment Software Assn. v. Granholm, 426 F.Supp.2d 646, 653 (E.D.Mich. 2006); Entertainment Software Assn. v. Blagojevich, 404 F.Supp.2d 1051, 1063 (N.D.Ill. 2005), aff'd, 469 F.3d 641 (C.A.7 2006).\n\n[7] One study, for example, found that children who had just finished playing violent video games were more likely to fill in the blank letter in \"explo_e\" with a \"d\" (so that it reads \"explode\") than with an \"r\" (\"explore\"). App. 496, 506 (internal quotation marks omitted). The prevention of this phenomenon, which might have been anticipated with common sense, is not a compelling state interest.\n\n[8] Justice ALITO is mistaken in thinking that we fail to take account of \"new and rapidly evolving technology,\" post, at 2742. The studies in question pertain to that new and rapidly evolving technology, and fail to show, with the degree of certitude that strict scrutiny requires, that this subject-matter restriction on speech is justified. Nor is Justice ALITO correct in attributing to us the view that \"violent video games really present no serious problem.\" Post, at 2742. Perhaps they do present a problem, and perhaps none of us would allow our own children to play them. But there are all sorts of \"problems\"—some of them surely more serious than this one— that cannot be addressed by governmental restriction of free expression: for example, the problem of encouraging anti-Semitism (National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43, 97 S.Ct. 2205, 53 L.Ed.2d 96 (1977) (per curiam)), the problem of spreading a political philosophy hostile to the Constitution (Noto v. United States, 367 U.S. 290, 81 S.Ct. 1517, 6 L.Ed.2d 836 (1961)), or the problem of encouraging disrespect for the Nation's flag (Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989)).\n\nJustice BREYER would hold that California has satisfied strict scrutiny based upon his own research into the issue of the harmfulness of violent video games. See post, at 2771-2779 (Appendixes to dissenting opinion) (listing competing academic articles discussing the harmfulness vel non of violent video games). The vast preponderance of this research is outside the record—and in any event we do not see how it could lead to Justice BREYER's conclusion, since he admits he cannot say whether the studies on his side are right or wrong. Post, at 2769. Similarly, Justice ALITO says he is not \"sure\" whether there are any constitutionally dispositive differences between video games and other media. Post, at 2742-2743. If that is so, then strict scrutiny plainly has not been satisfied.\n\n[9] Justice BREYER concludes that the remaining gap is compelling because, according to the FTC's report, some \"20% of those under 17 are still able to buy M-rated games.\" Post, at 2770 (citing FTC Report 28). But some gap in compliance is unavoidable. The sale of alcohol to minors, for example, has long been illegal, but a 2005 study suggests that about 18% of retailers still sell alcohol to those under the drinking age. Brief for State of Rhode Island et al. as Amici Curiae 18. Even if the sale of violent video games to minors could be deterred further by increasing regulation, the government does not have a compelling interest in each marginal percentage point by which its goals are advanced.ALITO CONCURRENCE FOOTNOTES[1] It is well established that a judgment may be affirmed on an alternative ground that was properly raised but not addressed by the lower court. Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U.S. 463, 478, n. 20, 99 S.Ct. 740, 58 L.Ed.2d 740 (1979).\n\n[2] Under the California law, a game that meets the threshold requirement set out in text also qualifies as \"violent\" if it \"[e]nables the player to virtually inflict serious injury upon images of human beings or characters with substantially human characteristics in a manner which is especially heinous, cruel, or depraved in that it involves torture or serious physical abuse to the victim.\" § 1746(d)(1)(B). In the Court of Appeals, California conceded that this alternative definition is unconstitutional, 556 F.3d 950, 954, n. 5 (C.A.9 2009), and therefore only the requirements set out in text are now before us.\n\n[3] The provision of New York law under which the petitioner was convicted in Ginsberg was framed with similar specificity. This provision applied to depictions of \"nudity\" and \"sexual conduct,\" and both those terms were specifically and unambiguously defined. See 390 U.S., at 645-647, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court).\n\n[4] The California law does not define the term \"maiming,\" nor has the State cited any decisions from its courts that define the term in this context. Accordingly, I take the term to have its ordinary meaning, which includes the infliction of any serious wound, see Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1362 (2002) (hereinafter Webster's).\n\n[5] At oral argument, California also proposed that the term \"minors\" could be interpreted as referring to the \"typical age group of minors\" who play video games. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. But nothing in the law's text supports such a limitation. Nor has California cited any decisions indicating that its courts would restrict the law in this way. And there is nothing in the record indicating what this age group might be.\n\n[6] A 2004 Federal Trade Commission Report showed that 69 percent of unaccompanied children ages 13 to 16 were able to buy M-rated games and that 56 percent of 13-year-olds were able to buy an M-rated game.

But the very nature of the print medium makes it impossible for a book to offer anything like the same number of choices as those provided by a video game.THOMAS DISSENT FOOTNOTES[1] Justice ALITO concludes that the law is too vague to satisfy due process, but neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals addressed that question. Ante, at 2742-2747 (opinion concurring in judgment). As we have often said, this Court is \"one of final review, `not of first view.'\" FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1800, 1819, 173 L.Ed.2d 738 (2009) (quoting Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718, n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005)).\n\n[2] The majority responds that \"it does not follow\" from the historical evidence \"that the state has the power to prevent children from hearing . . . anything without their parents' prior consent.\" Ante, at 2736, n. 3. Such a conclusion, the majority asserts, would lead to laws that, in its view, would be undesirable and \"obviously\" unconstitutional. Ibid.\n\nThe majority's circular argument misses the point. The question is not whether certain laws might make sense to judges or legislators today, but rather what the public likely understood \"the freedom of speech\" to mean when the First Amendment was adopted. See District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 634-635, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008). I believe it is clear that the founding public would not have understood \"the freedom of speech\" to include speech to minor children bypassing their parents. It follows that the First Amendment imposes no restriction on state regulation of such speech. To note that there may not be \"precedent for [such] state control,\" ante, at 2736, n. 3, \"is not to establish that [there] is a constitutional right,\" McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S. 334, 373, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n\n[3] Whether the statute would survive an as-applied challenge in the unusual case of an emancipated minor is a question for another day. To decide this case, it is enough that the statute is not unconstitutional on its face.",

The Federal District Court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined its enforcement. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\\n\\nHeld:  The Act does not comport with the First Amendment . Pp. 2–18.\\n\\n(a) Video games qualify for First Amendment protection. Like protected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through familiar literary devices and features distinctive to the medium. And “the basic principles of freedom of speech … do not vary” with a new and different communication medium. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson , 343 U. S. 495 . The most basic principle—that government lacks the power to restrict expression because of its message, ideas, subject matter, or content, Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union , 535 U. S. 564 —is subject to a few limited exceptions for historically unprotected speech, such as obscenity, incitement, and fighting words. But a legislature cannot create new categories of unprotected speech simply by weighing the value of a particular category against its social costs and then punishing it if it fails the test. See United States v. Stevens , 559 U. S. ___, ___. Unlike the New York law upheld in Ginsberg v. New York , 390 U. S. 629 , California’s Act does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children. Instead, the State wishes to create a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children. That is unprecedented and mistaken. This country has no tradition of specially restricting children’s access to depictions of violence. And California’s claim that “interactive” video games present special problems, in that the player participates in the violent action on screen and determines its outcome, is unpersuasive. Pp. 2–11.\\n\\n(b) Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny, i.e., it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest. R. A. V. v. St. Paul , 505 U. S. 377 . California cannot meet that standard. Psychological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively. Any demonstrated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media. Since California has declined to restrict those other media, e.g., Saturday morning cartoons, its video-game regulation is wildly underinclusive, raising serious doubts about whether the State is pursuing the interest it invokes or is instead disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint. California also cannot show that the Act’s restrictions meet the alleged substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children’s access to violent videos. The video-game industry’s voluntary rating system already accomplishes that to a large extent. Moreover, as a means of assisting parents the Act is greatly overinclusive, since not all of the children who are prohibited from purchasing violent video games have parents who disapprove of their doing so. The Act cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. Pp. 11–18.\\n\\n556 F. 3d 950, affirmed.\\n\\nScalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Alito, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Roberts, C. J., joined. Thomas, J., and Breyer, J., filed dissenting opinions.OPINION\\nJustice Scalia delivered the Opinion of the CourtWe consider whether a California law imposing restrictions on violent video games comports with the First Amendment .ICalifornia Assembly Bill 1179 (2005), Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §§1746–1746.5 (West 2009) (Act), prohibits the sale or rental of “violent video games” to minors, and requires their packaging to be labeled “18.” The Act covers games “in which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being, if those acts are depicted” in a manner that “[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors,” that is “patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors,” and that “causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.” §1746(d)(1)(A). Violation of the Act is punishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. §1746.3.\\nRespondents, representing the video-game and software industries, brought a preenforcement challenge to the Act in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. That court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined its enforcement. Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger , No. C–05–04188 RMW (2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. The Court of Appeals affirmed, Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger , 556 F. 3d 950 (CA9 2009), and we granted certiorari, 559 U. S. ____ (2010).IICalifornia correctly acknowledges that video games qualify for First Amendment protection. The Free Speech Clause exists principally to protect discourse on public matters, but we have long recognized that it is difficult to distinguish politics from entertainment, and dangerous to try. “Everyone is familiar with instances of propaganda through fiction. What is one man’s amusement, teaches another’s doctrine.” Winters v. New York , 333 U. S. 507, 510 (1948) . Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player’s interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection. Under our Constitution, “esthetic and moral judgments about art and literature … are for the individual to make, not for the Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval of a majority.” United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. , 529 U. S. 803, 818 (2000) . And whatever the challenges of applying the Constitution to ever-advancing technology, “the basic principles of freedom of speech and the press, like the First Amendment ’s command, do not vary” when a new and different medium for communication appears. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson , 343 U. S. 495, 503 (1952) .\\n\\nThe most basic of those principles is this: “[A]s a general matter, … government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union , 535 U. S. 564, 573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). There are of course exceptions. “ ‘From 1791 to the present,’ … the First Amendment has ‘permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,’ and has never ‘include[d] a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations.’ ” United States v. Stevens , 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (quoting R. A. V. v. St. Paul , 505 U. S. 377, 382–383 (1992) ). These limited areas—such as obscenity, Roth v. United States , 354 U. S. 476, 483 (1957) , incitement, Brandenburg v. Ohio , 395 U. S. 444, 447–449 (1969) (per curiam) , and fighting words, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire , 315 U. S. 568 , 572 (1942)—represent “well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,” id. , at 571–572.\\n\\nLast Term, in Stevens , we held that new categories of unprotected speech may not be added to the list by a legislature that concludes certain speech is too harmful to be tolerated. Stevens concerned a federal statute purporting to criminalize the creation, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty. See 18 U. S. C. §48 (amended 2010). The statute covered depictions “in which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed” if that harm to the animal was illegal where the “the creation, sale, or possession t[ook] place,” §48(c)(1). A saving clause largely borrowed from our obscenity jurisprudence, see Miller v. California , 413 U. S. 15, 24 (1973) , exempted depictions with “serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value,” §48(b). We held that statute to be an impermissible content-based restriction on speech. There was no American tradition of forbidding the depiction of animal cruelty—though States have long had laws against committing it.\\n\\nThe Government argued in Stevens that lack of a historical warrant did not matter; that it could create new categories of unprotected speech by applying a “simple balancing test” that weighs the value of a particular category of speech against its social costs and then punishes that category of speech if it fails the test. Stevens , 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). We emphatically rejected that “startling and dangerous” proposition. Ibid. “Maybe there are some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected, but have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 9). But without persuasive evidence that a novel restriction on content is part of a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of proscription, a legislature may not revise the “judgment [of] the American people,” embodied in the First Amendment , “that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the costs.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 7).\\n\\nThat holding controls this case. 1 As in Stevens , California has tried to make violent-speech regulation look like obscenity regulation by appending a saving clause required for the latter. That does not suffice. Our cases have been clear that the obscenity exception to the First Amendment does not cover whatever a legislature finds shocking, but only depictions of “sexual conduct,” Miller , supra, at 24. See also Cohen v. California , 403 U. S. 15, 20 (1971) ; Roth , supra, at 487, and n. 20.\\n\\nStevens was not the first time we have encountered and rejected a State’s attempt to shoehorn speech about violence into obscenity. In Winters , we considered a New York criminal statute “forbid[ding] the massing of stories of bloodshed and lust in such a way as to incite to crime against the person,” 333 U. S., at 514. The New York Court of Appeals upheld the provision as a law against obscenity. “[T]here can be no more precise test of written indecency or obscenity,” it said, “than the continuing and changeable experience of the community as to what types of books are likely to bring about the corruption of public morals or other analogous injury to the public order. ” Id. , at 514 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is of course the same expansive view of governmental power to abridge the freedom of speech based on interest-balancing that we rejected in Stevens . Our opinion in Winters , which concluded that the New York statute failed a heightened vagueness standard applicable to restrictions upon speech entitled to First Amendment protection, 333 U. S., at 517–519, made clear that violence is not part of the obscenity that the Constitution permits to be regulated. The speech reached by the statute contained “no indecency or obscenity in any sense heretofore known to the law.” Id. , at 519.\\n\\nBecause speech about violence is not obscene, it is of no consequence that California’s statute mimics the New York statute regulating obscenity-for-minors that we upheld in Ginsberg v. New York , 390 U. S. 629 (1968) . That case approved a prohibition on the sale to minors of sexual material that would be obscene from the perspective of a child. 2 We held that the legislature could “adjus[t] the definition of obscenity ‘to social realities by permitting the appeal of this type of material to be assessed in terms of the sexual interests …’ of … minors. ” Id. , at 638 (quoting Mishkin v. New York , 383 U. S. 502, 509 (1966) ). And because “obscenity is not protected expression,” the New York statute could be sustained so long as the legislature’s judgment that the proscribed materials were harmful to children “was not irrational.” 390 U. S., at 641.\\n\\nThe California Act is something else entirely. It does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children. California does not argue that it is empowered to prohibit selling offensively violent works to adults —and it is wise not to, since that is but a hair’s breadth from the argument rejected in Stevens . Instead, it wishes to create a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children.\\n\\nThat is unprecedented and mistaken. “[M]inors are entitled to a significant measure of First Amendment protection, and only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to them.” Erznoznik v. Jacksonville , 422 U. S. 205, 212–213 (1975) (citation omitted). No doubt a State possesses legitimate power to protect children from harm, Ginsberg , supra , at 640–641; Prince v. Massachusetts , 321 U. S. 158, 165 (1944) , but that does not include a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed. “Speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.” Erznoznik , supra, at 213–214. 3\\n\\nCalifornia’s argument would fare better if there were a longstanding tradition in this country of specially restricting children’s access to depictions of violence, but there is none. Certainly the books we give children to read—or read to them when they are younger—contain no shortage of gore. Grimm’s Fairy Tales, for example, are grim indeed. As her just deserts for trying to poison Snow White, the wicked queen is made to dance in red hot slippers “till she fell dead on the floor, a sad example of envy and jealousy.” The Complete Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales 198 (2006 ed.). Cinderella’s evil stepsisters have their eyes pecked out by doves. Id. , at 95. And Hansel and Gretel (children!) kill their captor by baking her in an oven. Id. , at 54.\\n\\nHigh-school reading lists are full of similar fare. Homer’s Odysseus blinds Polyphemus the Cyclops by grinding out his eye with a heated stake. The Odyssey of Homer, Book IX, p. 125 (S. Butcher & A. Lang transls. 1909) (“Even so did we seize the fiery-pointed brand and whirled it round in his eye, and the blood flowed about the heated bar. And the breath of the flame singed his eyelids and brows all about, as the ball of the eye burnt away, and the roots thereof crackled in the flame”). In the Inferno, Dante and Virgil watch corrupt politicians struggle to stay submerged beneath a lake of boiling pitch, lest they be skewered by devils above the surface. Canto XXI, pp. 187–189 (A. Mandelbaum transl. Bantam Classic ed. 1982). And Golding’s Lord of the Flies recounts how a schoolboy called Piggy is savagely murdered by other children while marooned on an island. W. Golding, Lord of the Flies 208–209 (1997 ed.). 4\\n\\nThis is not to say that minors’ consumption of violent entertainment has never encountered resistance. In the 1800’s, dime novels depicting crime and “penny dreadfuls” (named for their price and content) were blamed in some quarters for juvenile delinquency. See Brief for Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae 6–7. When motion pictures came along, they became the villains instead. “The days when the police looked upon dime novels as the most dangerous of textbooks in the school for crime are drawing to a close… . They say that the moving picture machine … tends even more than did the dime novel to turn the thoughts of the easily influenced to paths which sometimes lead to prison.” Moving Pictures as Helps to Crime, N. Y. Times, Feb. 21, 1909, quoted in Brief for Cato Institute, at 8. For a time, our Court did permit broad censorship of movies because of their capacity to be “used for evil,” see Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm’n of Ohio , 236 U. S. 230, 242 (1915) , but we eventually reversed course, Joseph Burstyn, Inc. , 343 U. S., at 502; see also Erznoznik , supra, at 212–214 (invalidating a drive-in movies restriction designed to protect children). Radio dramas were next, and then came comic books. Brief for Cato Institute, at 10–11. Many in the late 1940’s and early 1950’s blamed comic books for fostering a “preoccupation with violence and horror” among the young, leading to a rising juvenile crime rate. See Note, Regulation of Comic Books, 68 H arv . L. R ev . 489, 490 (1955). But efforts to convince Congress to restrict comic books failed. Brief for Comic Book Legal Defense Fund as Amicus Curiae 11–15. 5 And, of course, after comic books came television and music lyrics.\\n\\nCalifornia claims that video games present special problems because they are “interactive,” in that the player participates in the violent action on screen and determines its outcome. The latter feature is nothing new: Since at least the publication of The Adventures of You: Sugarcane Island in 1969, young readers of choose-your-own-adventure stories have been able to make decisions that determine the plot by following instructions about which page to turn to. Cf. Interactive Digital Software Assn. v. St. Louis County, 329 F. 3d 954, 957–958 (CA8 2003). As for the argument that video games enable participation in the violent action, that seems to us more a matter of degree than of kind. As Judge Posner has observed, all literature is interactive. “[T]he better it is, the more interactive. Literature when it is successful draws the reader into the story, makes him identify with the characters, invites him to judge them and quarrel with them, to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader’s own.” American Amusement Machine Assn. v. Kendrick , 244 F. 3d 572, 577 (CA7 2001) (striking down a similar restriction on violent video games).\\nJustice Alito has done considerable independent re-search to identify, see post , at 14–15, nn. 13–18, video games in which “the violence is astounding,” post , at 14. “Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces. . . . Blood gushes, splatters, and pools.” Ibid. Justice Alito recounts all these disgusting video games in order to disgust us—but disgust is not a valid basis for restricting expression. And the same is true of Justice Alito ’s description, post , at 14–15, of those video games he has discovered that have a racial or ethnic motive for their violence—“ ‘ethnic cleansing’ [of] . . . African Americans, Latinos, or Jews.” To what end does he relate this? Does it somehow increase the “aggressiveness” that California wishes to suppress? Who knows? But it does arouse the reader’s ire, and the reader’s desire to put an end to this horrible message. Thus, ironically, Justice Alito ’s argument highlights the precise danger posed by the California Act: that the ideas expressed by speech—whether it be violence, or gore, or racism—and not its objective effects, may be the real reason for governmental proscription.IIIBecause the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny—that is, unless it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest. R. A. V. , 505 U. S., at 395. The State must specifically identify an “actual problem” in need of solving, Playboy , 529 U. S., at 822–823, and the curtailment of free speech must be actually necessary to the solution, see R. A. V. , supra, at 395. That is a demanding standard. “It is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible.” Playboy , supra, at 818.\\n\\nCalifornia cannot meet that standard. At the outset, it acknowledges that it cannot show a direct causal link between violent video games and harm to minors. Rather, relying upon our decision in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC , 512 U. S. 622 (1994) , the State claims that it need not produce such proof because the legislature can make a predictive judgment that such a link exists, based on competing psychological studies. But reliance on Turner Broadcasting is misplaced. That decision applied intermediate scrutiny to a content-neutral regulation. Id. , at 661–662. California’s burden is much higher, and because it bears the risk of uncertainty, see Playboy , supra, at 816–817, ambiguous proof will not suffice.\\n\\nThe State’s evidence is not compelling. California relies primarily on the research of Dr. Craig Anderson and a few other research psychologists whose studies purport to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children. These studies have been rejected by every court to consider them, 6 and with good reason: They do not prove that violent video games cause minors to act aggressively (which would at least be a beginning). Instead, “[n]early all of the research is based on correlation, not evidence of causation, and most of the studies suffer from significant, admitted flaws in methodology.” Video Software Dealers Assn. 556 F. 3d, at 964. They show at best some correlation between exposure to violent entertainment and minuscule real-world effects, such as children’s feeling more aggressive or making louder noises in the few minutes after playing a violent game than after playing a nonviolent game. 7\\n\\nEven taking for granted Dr. Anderson’s conclusions that violent video games produce some effect on children’s feelings of aggression, those effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media. In his testimony in a similar lawsuit, Dr. Anderson admitted that the “effect sizes” of children’s exposure to violent video games are “about the same” as that produced by their exposure to violence on television. App. 1263. And he admits that the same effects have been found when children watch cartoons starring Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner, id., at 1304, or when they play video games like Sonic the Hedgehog that are rated “E” (appropriate for all ages), id., at 1270, or even when they “vie[w] a picture of a gun,” id., at 1315–1316. 8\\n\\nOf course, California has (wisely) declined to restrict Saturday morning cartoons, the sale of games rated for young children, or the distribution of pictures of guns. The consequence is that its regulation is wildly underinclusive when judged against its asserted justification, which in our view is alone enough to defeat it. Underinclusiveness raises serious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint. See City of Ladue v. Gilleo , 512 U. S. 43, 51 (1994) ; Florida Star v. B. J. F. , 491 U. S. 524, 540 (1989) . Here, California has singled out the purveyors of video games for disfavored treatment—at least when compared to booksellers, cartoonists, and movie producers—and has given no persuasive reason why.\\n\\nThe Act is also seriously underinclusive in another respect—and a respect that renders irrelevant the contentions of the concurrence and the dissents that video games are qualitatively different from other portrayals of violence. The California Legislature is perfectly willing to leave this dangerous, mind-altering material in the hands of children so long as one parent (or even an aunt or uncle) says it’s OK. And there are not even any requirements as to how this parental or avuncular relationship is to be verified; apparently the child’s or putative parent’s, aunt’s, or uncle’s say-so suffices. That is not how one addresses a serious social problem.\\n\\nCalifornia claims that the Act is justified in aid of parental authority: By requiring that the purchase of violent video games can be made only by adults, the Act ensures that parents can decide what games are appropriate. At the outset, we note our doubts that punishing third parties for conveying protected speech to children just in case their parents disapprove of that speech is a proper governmental means of aiding parental authority. Accepting that position would largely vitiate the rule that “only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to [minors].” Erznoznik , 422 U. S., at 212–213.\\n\\nBut leaving that aside, California cannot show that the Act’s restrictions meet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children’s access to violent video games but cannot do so. The video-game industry has in place a voluntary rating system designed to inform consumers about the content of games. The system, implemented by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), assigns age-specific ratings to each video game submitted: EC (Early Childhood); E (Everyone); E10+ (Everyone 10 and older); T (Teens); M (17 and older); and AO (Adults Only—18 and older). App. 86. The Video Software Dealers Association encourages retailers to prominently display information about the ESRB system in their stores; to refrain from renting or selling adults-only games to minors; and to rent or sell “M” rated games to minors only with parental consent. Id., at 47. In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that, as a result of this system, “the video game industry outpaces the movie and music industries” in “(1) restricting target-marketing of mature-rated products to children; (2) clearly and prominently disclosing rating information; and (3) re-stricting children’s access to mature-rated products at retail.” FTC, Report to Congress, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 30 (Dec. 2009), online at http:// www.ftc.gov / os/ 2009 / 12/ P994511violententertainment.pdf (as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file) (FTC Report). This system does much to ensure that minors cannot purchase seriously violent games on their own, and that parents who care about the matter can readily evaluate the games their children bring home. Filling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents’ control can hardly be a compelling state interest. 9\\n\\nAnd finally, the Act’s purported aid to parental authority is vastly overinclusive. Not all of the children who are forbidden to purchase violent video games on their own have parents who care whether they purchase violent video games. While some of the legislation’s effect may indeed be in support of what some parents of the restricted children actually want, its entire effect is only in support of what the State thinks parents ought to want. This is not the narrow tailoring to “assisting parents” that restriction of First Amendment rights requires.\\n\\n*\\u2003\\u2003*\\u2003\\u2003*\\n\\nCalifornia’s effort to regulate violent video games is the latest episode in a long series of failed attempts to censor violent entertainment for minors. While we have pointed out above that some of the evidence brought forward to support the harmfulness of video games is unpersuasive, we do not mean to demean or disparage the concerns that underlie the attempt to regulate them—concerns that may and doubtless do prompt a good deal of parental oversight. We have no business passing judgment on the view of the California Legislature that violent video games (or, for that matter, any other forms of speech) corrupt the young or harm their moral development. Our task is only to say whether or not such works constitute a “well-defined and narrowly limited clas[s] of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem,” Chaplinsky , 315 U. S., at 571–572 (the answer plainly is no); and if not, whether the regulation of such works is justified by that high degree of necessity we have described as a compelling state interest (it is not). Even where the protection of children is the object, the constitutional limits on governmental action apply.\\n\\nCalifornia’s legislation straddles the fence between (1) addressing a serious social problem and (2) helping concerned parents control their children. Both ends are legitimate, but when they affect First Amendment rights they must be pursued by means that are neither seriously underinclusive nor seriously overinclusive. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520, 546 (1993) . As a means of protecting children from portrayals of violence, the legislation is seriously underinclusive, not only because it excludes portrayals other than video games, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular veto. And as a means of assisting concerned parents it is seriously overinclusive because it abridges the First Amendment rights of young people whose parents (and aunts and uncles) think violent video games are a harmless pastime. And the overbreadth in achieving one goal is not cured by the underbreadth in achieving the other. Legislation such as this, which is neither fish nor fowl, cannot survive strict scrutiny.\\n\\nWe affirm the judgment below.\\nIt is so ordered.Justice ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring in the judgment.The California statute that is before us in this case represents a pioneering effort to address what the state legislature and others regard as a potentially serious social problem: the effect of exceptionally violent video games on impressionable minors, who often spend countless hours immersed in the alternative worlds that these games create. Although the California statute is well intentioned, its terms are not framed with the precision that the Constitution demands, and I therefore agree with the Court that this particular law cannot be sustained.\\n\\nI disagree, however, with the approach taken in the Court\\'s opinion. In considering the application of unchanging constitutional principles to new and rapidly evolving technology, this Court should proceed with caution. We should make every effort to understand the new technology. We should take into account the possibility that developing technology may have important societal implications that will become apparent only with time. We should not jump to the conclusion that new technology is fundamentally the same as some older thing with which we are familiar. And we should not hastily dismiss the judgment of legislators, who may be in a better position than we are to assess the implications of new technology. The opinion of the Court exhibits none of this caution.\\n\\nIn the view of the Court, all those concerned about the effects of violent video games—federal and state legislators, educators, social scientists, and parents—are unduly fearful, for violent video games really present no serious problem. See ante, at 2737-2739, 2740-2741. Spending hour upon hour controlling the actions of a character who guns down scores of innocent victims is not different in \"kind\" from reading a description of violence in a work of literature. See ante, at 2737-2738.\\n\\nThe Court is sure of this; I am not. There are reasons to suspect that the experience of playing violent video games just might be very different from reading a book, listening to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show.IRespondents in this case, representing the video-game industry, ask us to strike down the California law on two grounds: The broad ground adopted by the Court and the narrower ground that the law\\'s definition of \"violent video game,\" see Cal. Civ.Code Ann. § 1746(d)(1)(A) (West 2009), is impermissibly vague. See Brief for Respondents 23-61. Because I agree with the latter argument, I see no need to reach the broader First Amendment issues addressed by the Court.[1]ADue process requires that laws give people of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited. Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). The lack of such notice in a law that regulates expression \"raises special First Amendment concerns because of its obvious chilling effect on free speech.\" Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 871-872, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997). Vague laws force potential speakers to \"`steer far wider of the unlawful zone\\' . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\" Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 372, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964) (quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958)). While \"perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity,\" Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 794, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989), \"government may regulate in the area\" of First Amendment freedoms \"only with narrow specificity,\" NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963); see also Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). These principles apply to laws that regulate expression for the purpose of protecting children. See Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas, 390 U.S. 676, 689, 88 S.Ct. 1298, 20 L.Ed.2d 225 (1968).\\n\\nHere, the California law does not define \"violent video games\" with the \"narrow specificity\" that the Constitution demands. In an effort to avoid First Amendment problems, the California Legislature modeled its violent video game statute on the New York law that this Court upheld in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968)—a law that prohibited the sale of certain sexually related materials to minors, see id., at 631-633, 88 S.Ct. 1274. But the California Legislature departed from the Ginsberg model in an important respect, and the legislature overlooked important differences between the materials falling within the scope of the two statutes.BThe law at issue in Ginsberg prohibited the sale to minors of materials that were deemed \"harmful to minors,\" and the law defined \"harmful to minors\" simply by adding the words \"for minors\" to each element of the definition of obscenity set out in what were then the Court\\'s leading obscenity decisions, see Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957), and Book Named \"John Cleland\\'s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\" v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975, 16 L.Ed.2d 1 (1966).\\n\\nSeeking to bring its violent video game law within the protection of Ginsberg, the California Legislature began with the obscenity test adopted in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), a decision that revised the obscenity tests previously set out in Roth and Memoirs. The legislature then made certain modifications to accommodate the aim of the violent video game law.\\n\\nUnder Miller, an obscenity statute must contain a thresh-old limitation that restricts the statute\\'s scope to specifically described \"hard core\" materials. See 413 U.S., at 23-25, 27, 93 S.Ct. 2607. Materials that fall within this \"hard core\" category may be deemed to be obscene if three additional requirements are met:\\n\\n(1) an \"average person, applying contemporary community standards [must] find . . . the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\";\\n\\n(2) \"the work [must] depic[t] or describ[e], in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and\"\\n\\n(3) \"the work, taken as a whole, [must] lac[k] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\" Id., at 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607 (internal quotation marks omitted).\\n\\nAdapting these standards, the California law imposes the following threshold limitation: \"[T]he range of options available to a player [must] includ[e] killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being.\" § 1746(d)(1). Any video game that meets this threshold test is subject to the law\\'s restrictions if it also satisfies three further requirements:(i) A reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find [the game] appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors.\\n\\n\"(ii) It is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors.\\n\\n\"(iii) It causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\" § 1746(d)(1)(A).[2]CThe first important difference between the Ginsberg law and the California violent video game statute concerns their respective threshold requirements. As noted, the Ginsberg law built upon the test for adult obscenity, and the current adult obscenity test, which was set out in Miller, requires an obscenity statute to contain a threshold limitation that restricts the statute\\'s coverage to specifically defined \"hard core\" depictions. See 413 U.S., at 23-25, 27, 93 S.Ct. 2607. The Miller Court gave as an example a statute that applies to only \"[p]atently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts,\" \"masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.\" Id., at 25, 93 S.Ct. 2607. The Miller Court clearly viewed this threshold limitation as serving a vital notice function. \"We are satisfied,\" the Court wrote, \"that these specific prerequisites will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials that his public and commercial activities may bring prosecution.\" Id., at 27, 93 S.Ct. 2607; see also Reno, supra, at 873, 117 S.Ct. 2329 (observing that Miller\\'s threshold limitation \"reduces the vagueness inherent in the open-ended term `patently offensive\\'\").[3]\\n\\nBy contrast, the threshold requirement of the California law does not perform the narrowing function served by the limitation in Miller. At least when Miller was decided, depictions of \"hard core\" sexual conduct were not a common feature of mainstream entertainment. But nothing similar can be said about much of the conduct covered by the California law. It provides that a video game cannot qualify as \"violent\" unless \"the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being.\" § 1746(d)(1).\\n\\nFor better or worse, our society has long regarded many depictions of killing and maiming[4] as suitable features of popular entertainment, including entertainment that is widely available to minors. The California law\\'s threshold requirement would more closely resemble the limitation in Miller if it targeted a narrower class of graphic depictions.\\n\\nBecause of this feature of the California law\\'s threshold test, the work of providing fair notice is left in large part to the three requirements that follow, but those elements are also not up to the task. In drafting the violent video game law, the California Legislature could have made its own judgment regarding the kind and degree of violence that is acceptable in games played by minors (or by minors in particular age groups). Instead, the legislature relied on undefined societal or community standards.\\n\\nOne of the three elements at issue here refers expressly to \"prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors.\" § 1746(d)(1)(A)(ii). Another element points in the same direction, asking whether \"[a] reasonable person, considering [a] game as a whole,\" would find that it \"appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors.\" § 1746(d)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added).\\n\\nThe terms \"deviant\" and \"morbid\" are not defined in the statute, and California offers no reason to think that its courts would give the terms anything other than their ordinary meaning. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 5 (arguing that \"[a] reasonable person can make this judgment through . . . a common understanding and definition of the applicable terms\"). I therefore assume that \"deviant\" and \"morbid\" carry the meaning that they convey in ordinary speech. The adjective \"deviant\" ordinarily means \"deviating . . . from some accepted norm,\" and the term \"morbid\" means \"of, relating to, or characteristic of disease.\" Webster\\'s 618, 1469. A \"deviant or morbid interest\" in violence, therefore, appears to be an interest that deviates from what is regarded—presumably in accordance with some generally accepted standard—as normal and healthy. Thus, the application of the California law is heavily dependent on the identification of generally accepted standards regarding the suitability of violent entertainment for minors.\\n\\nThe California Legislature seems to have assumed that these standards are sufficiently well known so that a person of ordinary intelligence would have fair notice as to whether the kind and degree of violence in a particular game is enough to qualify the game as \"violent.\" And because the Miller test looks to community standards, the legislature may have thought that the use of undefined community standards in the violent video game  law would not present vagueness problems.\\n\\nThere is a critical difference, however, between obscenity laws and laws regulating violence in entertainment. By the time of this Court\\'s landmark obscenity cases in the 1960\\'s, obscenity had long been prohibited, see Roth, 354 U.S., at 484-485, 77 S.Ct. 1304, and this experience had helped to shape certain generally accepted norms concerning expression related to sex.\\n\\nThere is no similar history regarding expression related to violence. As the Court notes, classic literature contains descriptions of great violence, and even children\\'s stories sometimes depict very violent scenes. See ante, at 2736-2737.\\n\\nAlthough our society does not generally regard all depictions of violence as suitable for children or adolescents, the prevalence of violent depictions in children\\'s literature and entertainment creates numerous opportunities for reasonable people to disagree about which depictions may excite \"deviant\" or \"morbid\" impulses. See Edwards & Berman, Regulating Violence on Television, 89 Nw. U.L.Rev. 1487, 1523 (1995) (observing that the Miller test would be difficult to apply to violent expression because \"there is nothing even approaching a consensus on low-value violence\").\\n\\nFinally, the difficulty of ascertaining the community standards incorporated into the California law is compounded by the legislature\\'s decision to lump all minors together. The California law draws no distinction between young children and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority.\\n\\nIn response to a question at oral argument, the attorney defending the constitutionality of the California law said that the State would accept a narrowing construction of the law under which the law\\'s references to \"minors\" would be interpreted to refer to the oldest minors—that is, those just short of 18. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12. However, \"it is not within our power to construe and narrow state laws.\" Grayned, 408 U.S., at 110, 92 S.Ct. 2294. We can only \"`extrapolate [their] allowable meaning\\'\" from the statutory text and authoritative interpretations of similar laws by courts of the State. Ibid. (quoting Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U.S. 157, 174, 82 S.Ct. 248, 7 L.Ed.2d 207 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment)).\\n\\nIn this case, California has not provided any evidence that the California Legislature intended the law to be limited in this way, or cited any decisions from its courts that would support an \"oldest minors\" construction.[5]\\n\\nFor these reasons, I conclude that the California violent video game law fails to provide the fair notice that the Constitution requires. And I would go no further. I would not express any view on whether a properly drawn statute would or would not survive First Amendment scrutiny. We should address that question only if and when it is necessary to do so.IIHaving outlined how I would decide this case, I will now briefly elaborate on my reasons for questioning the wisdom of the Court\\'s approach. Some of these reasons are touched upon by the dissents, and while I am not prepared at this time to go as far as either Justice THOMAS or Justice BREYER, they raise valid concerns.AThe Court is wrong in saying that the holding in United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010), \"controls this case.\" Ante, at 2734. First, the statute in Stevens differed sharply from the statute at issue here. Stevens struck down a law that broadly prohibited any person from creating, selling, or possessing depictions of animal cruelty for commercial gain. The California law involved here, by contrast, is limited to the sale or rental of violent video games to minors. The California law imposes no restriction on the creation of violent video games, or on the possession of such games by anyone, whether above or below the age of 18. The California law does not regulate the sale or rental of violent games by adults. And the California law does not prevent parents and certain other close relatives from buying or renting violent games for their children or other young relatives if they see fit.\\n\\nSecond, Stevens does not support the proposition that a law like the one at issue must satisfy strict scrutiny. The portion of Stevens on which the Court relies rejected the Government\\'s contention that depictions of animal cruelty were categorically outside the range of any First Amendment protection. 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1582. Going well beyond Stevens, the Court now holds that any law that attempts to prevent minors from purchasing violent video games must satisfy strict scrutiny instead of the more lenient standard applied in Ginsberg, 390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195, our most closely related precedent. As a result of today\\'s decision, a State may prohibit the sale to minors of what Ginsberg described as \"girlie magazines,\" but a State must surmount a formidable (and perhaps insurmountable) obstacle if it wishes to prevent children from purchasing the most violent and depraved video games imaginable.\\n\\nThird, Stevens expressly left open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute targeting depictions of animal cruelty might be compatible with the First Amendment. See 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1592. In this case, the Court\\'s sweeping opinion will likely be read by many, both inside and outside the video-game industry, as suggesting that no regulation of minors\\' access to violent video games is allowed—at least without supporting evidence that may not be realistically obtainable given the nature of the phenomenon in question.BThe Court\\'s opinion distorts the effect of the California law. I certainly agree with the Court that the government has no \"free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed,\" ante, at 2736, but the California law does not exercise such a power. If parents want their child to have a violent video game, the California law does not interfere with that parental prerogative. Instead, the California law reinforces parental decisionmaking in exactly the same way as the New York statute upheld in Ginsberg. Under both laws, minors are prevented from purchasing certain materials; and under both laws, parents are free to supply their children with these items if that is their wish.\\n\\nCiting the video-game industry\\'s voluntary rating system, the Court argues that the California law does not \"meet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict their children\\'s access to violent video games but cannot do so.\" Ante, at 2740. The Court does not mention the fact that the industry adopted this system in response to the threat of federal regulation, Brief for Activision Blizzard, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 7-10, a threat that the Court\\'s opinion may now be seen as largely eliminating. Nor does the Court acknowledge that compliance with this system at the time of the enactment of the California law left much to be desired[6]— or that future enforcement may decline if the video-game industry perceives that any threat of government regulation has vanished. Nor does the Court note, as Justice BREYER points out, see post, at 2767 (dissenting opinion), that many parents today are simply not able to monitor their children\\'s use of computers and gaming devices.CFinally, the Court is far too quick to dismiss the possibility that the experience of playing video games (and the effects on minors of playing violent video games) may be very different from anything that we have seen before. Any assessment of the experience of playing video games must take into account certain characteristics of the video games that are now on the market and those that are likely to be available in the near future.\\n\\nToday\\'s most advanced video games create realistic alternative worlds in which millions of players immerse themselves for hours on end. These games feature visual imagery and sounds that are strikingly realistic, and in the near future video-game graphics may be virtually indistinguishable from actual video footage.[7] Many of the games already on the market can produce high definition images,[8] and it is predicted that it will not be long before video-game images will be seen in three dimensions.[9] It is also forecast that video games will soon provide sensory feedback.[10] By wearing a special vest or other device, a player will be able to experience physical sensations supposedly felt by a character  on the screen.[11] Some amici who support respondents foresee the day when \"`virtual-reality shoot-`em-ups\\'\" will allow children to \"`actually feel the splatting blood from the blown-off head\\'\" of a victim. Brief for Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press et al. as Amici Curiae 29 (quoting H. Schechter, Savage Pastimes 18 (2005)).\\n\\nPersons who play video games also have an unprecedented ability to participate in the events that take place in the virtual worlds that these games create. Players can create their own video-game characters and can use photos to produce characters that closely resemble actual people. A person playing a sophisticated game can make a multitude of choices and can thereby alter the course of the action in the game. In addition, the means by which players control the action in video games now bear a closer relationship to the means by which people control action in the real world. While the action in older games was often directed with buttons or a joystick, players dictate the action in newer games by engaging in the same motions that they desire a character in the game to perform.[12] For example, a player who wants a video-game character to swing a baseball bat—either to hit a ball or smash a skull—could bring that about by simulating the motion of actually swinging a bat.\\n\\nThese present-day and emerging characteristics of video games must be considered together with characteristics of the violent games that have already been marketed.\\n\\nIn some of these games, the violence is astounding.[13] Victims by the dozens are killed with every imaginable implement, including machine guns, shotguns, clubs, hammers, axes, swords, and chainsaws. Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces. They cry out in agony and beg for mercy. Blood gushes, splatters, and pools. Severed body parts and gobs of human remains are graphically shown. In some games, points are awarded based, not only on the number of victims killed, but on the killing technique employed.\\n\\nIt also appears that there is no antisocial theme too base for some in the video-game industry to exploit. There are games in which a player can take on the identity and reenact the killings carried out by the perpetrators of the murders at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech.[14] The objective of one game is to rape a mother and her daughters;[15] in another, the goal is to rape Native American women.[16] There is a game in which players engage in \"ethnic cleansing\" and can choose to gun down African-Americans, Latinos, or Jews.[17] In still another game, players attempt to fire a rifle shot into the head of President Kennedy as his motorcade passes by the Texas School Book Depository.[18]\\n\\nIf the technological characteristics of the sophisticated games that are likely to be available in the near future are combined with the characteristics of the most violent games already marketed, the result will be games that allow troubled teens to experience in an extraordinarily personal and vivid way what it would be like to carry out unspeakable acts of violence.\\n\\nThe Court is untroubled by this possibility. According to the Court, the \"interactive\" nature of video games is \"nothing new\" because \"all literature is interactive.\" Ante, at 2738. Disagreeing with this assessment, the International Game Developers Association (IGDA)—a group that presumably understands the nature of video games and that supports respondents— tells us that video games are \"far more concretely interactive.\" Brief for IGDA et al. as Amici Curiae 3. And on this point, the game developers are surely correct.\\n\\nIt is certainly true, as the Court notes, that \"`[l]iterature, when it is successful draws the reader into the story, makes him identify with the characters, invites him to judge them and quarrel with them, to experience their joys and sufferings as the reader\\'s own.\\'\" Ante, at 2738 (quoting American Amusement Machine Assn. v. Kendrick, 244 F.3d 572, 577 (C.A.7 2001)). But only an extraordinarily imaginative reader who reads a description of a killing in a literary work will experience that event as vividly as he might if he played the role of the killer in a video game. To take an example, think of a person who reads the passage in Crime and Punishment in which Raskolnikov kills the old pawn broker with an axe. See F. Dostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment 78 (Modern Library ed.1950). Compare that reader with a video-game player who creates an avatar that bears his own image; who sees a realistic image of the victim and the scene of the killing in high definition and in three dimensions; who is forced to decide whether or not to kill the victim and decides to do so; who then pretends to grasp an axe, to raise it above the head of the victim, and then to bring it down; who hears the thud of the axe hitting her head and her cry of pain; who sees her split skull and feels the sensation of blood on his face and hands. For most people, the two experiences will not be the same.[19]\\n\\nWhen all of the characteristics of video games are taken into account, there is certainly a reasonable basis for thinking that the experience of playing a video game may be quite different from the experience of reading a book, listening to a radio broadcast, or viewing a movie. And if this is so, then for at least some minors, the effects of playing violent video games may also be quite different. The Court acts prematurely in dismissing this possibility out of hand.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nFor all these reasons, I would hold only that the particular law at issue here fails to provide the clear notice that the Constitution requires. I would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem. If differently framed statutes are enacted by the States or by the Federal Government, we can consider the constitutionality of those laws when cases challenging them are presented to us.Justice THOMAS, dissenting.The Court\\'s decision today does not comport with the original public understanding of the First Amendment. The majority strikes down, as facially unconstitutional, a state law that prohibits the direct sale or rental of certain video games to minors because the law \"abridg[es] the freedom of speech.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 1. But I do not think the First Amendment stretches that far. The practices and beliefs of the founding generation establish that \"the freedom of speech,\" as originally understood, does not include a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors\\' parents or guardians. I would hold that the law at issue is not facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment, and reverse and remand for further proceedings.[1]IWhen interpreting a constitutional provision, \"the goal is to discern the most likely public understanding of [that] provision at the time it was adopted.\" McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___, ___, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 3072, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Because the Constitution is a written instrument, \"its meaning does not alter.\" McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm\\'n, 514 U.S. 334, 359, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"That which it meant when adopted, it means now.\" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\\n\\nAs originally understood, the First Amendment\\'s protection against laws \"abridging the freedom of speech\" did not extend to all speech. \"There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem.\" Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571-572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942); see also United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S.  ___, ___, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 1582-1583, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010). Laws regulating such speech do not \"abridg[e] the freedom of speech\" because such speech is understood to fall outside \"the freedom of speech.\" See Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 245-246, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002).\\n\\nIn my view, the \"practices and beliefs held by the Founders\" reveal another category of excluded speech: speech to minor children bypassing their parents. McIntyre, supra, at 360, 115 S.Ct. 1511. The historical evidence shows that the founding generation believed parents had absolute authority over their minor children and expected parents to use that authority to direct the proper development of their children. It would be absurd to suggest that such a society understood \"the freedom of speech\" to include a right to speak to minors (or a corresponding right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors\\' parents. Cf. Brief for Common Sense Media as Amicus Curiae 12-15. The founding generation would not have considered it an abridgment of \"the freedom of speech\" to support parental authority by restricting speech that bypasses minors\\' parents.AAttitudes toward children were in a state of transition around the time that the States ratified the Bill of Rights. A complete understanding of the founding generation\\'s views on children and the parent-child relationship must therefore begin roughly a century earlier, in colonial New England.\\n\\nIn the Puritan tradition common in the New England Colonies, fathers ruled families with absolute authority. \"The patriarchal family was the basic building block of Puritan society.\" S. Mintz, Huck\\'s Raft 13 (2004) (hereinafter Mintz); see also R. MacDonald, Literature for Children in England and America from 1646 to 1774, p. 7 (1982) (hereinafter MacDonald). The Puritans rejected many customs, such as godparenthood, that they considered inconsistent with the patriarchal structure. Mintz 13.\\n\\nPart of the father\\'s absolute power was the right and duty \"to fill his children\\'s minds with knowledge and . . . make them apply their knowledge in right action.\" E. Morgan, The Puritan Family 97 (rev. ed.1966) (herein-after Morgan). Puritans thought children were \"innately sinful and that parents\\' primary task was to suppress their children\\'s natural depravity.\" S. Mintz & S. Kellogg, Domestic Revolutions 2 (1988) (hereinafter Mintz & Kellogg); see also B. Wadsworth, The Well-Ordered Family 55 (1712) (\"Children should not be left to themselves . . . to do as they please;. . . not being fit to govern themselves\"); C. Mather, A Family Well-Ordered 38 (1699). Accordingly, parents were not to let their children read \"vain Books, profane Ballads, and filthy Songs\" or \"fond and amorous Romances, . . . fabulous Histories of Giants, the bombast Achievements of Knight Errantry, and the like.\" The History of Genesis, pp. vi-vii (3d ed. corrected 1708).\\n\\nThis conception of parental authority was reflected in laws at that time. In the Massachusetts Colony, for example, it was unlawful for tavern keepers (or anyone else) to entertain children without their parents\\' consent. 2 Records and Files of the Quarterly Courts of Essex County, Massachusetts, p. 180 (1912); 4 id., at 237, 275 (1914); 5 id., at 143 (1916); see also Morgan 146. And a \"stubborn or rebellious son\" of 16 years or more committed a capital offense if he disobeyed \"the voice of his Father, or the voice of his Mother.\" The Laws and Liberties of Massachusetts 6 (1648) (reprint M. Farrand ed.1929); see also J. Kamensky, Governing the Tongue 102, n. 14 (1997) (citing similar laws in the Connecticut, New Haven, Plymouth, and New Hampshire Colonies in the late 1600\\'s).BIn the decades leading up to and following the Revolution, attitudes towards children changed. See, e.g., J. Reinier, From Virtue to Character: American Childhood, 1775-1850, p. 1 (1996) (hereinafter Reinier). Children came to be seen less as innately sinful and more as blank slates requiring careful and deliberate development. But the same overarching principles remained. Parents continued to have both the right and duty to ensure the proper development of their children. They exercised significant authority over their children, including control over the books that children read. And laws at the time continued to reflect strong support for parental authority and the sense that children were not fit to govern themselves.1The works of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were a driving force behind the changed understanding of children and childhood. See Reinier 2-5; H. Brewer, By Birth or Consent 97 (2005) (hereinafter Brewer); K. Calvert, Children in the House 59-60 (1992) (hereinafter Calvert). Locke taught that children\\'s minds were blank slates and that parents therefore had to be careful and deliberate about what their children were told and observed. Parents had only themselves to blame if, \"by humouring and cockering\" their children, they \"poison\\'d the fountain\" and later \"taste[d] the bitter waters.\" Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1692), in 37 English Philosophers of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries 27-28 (C. Eliot ed.1910). All vices, he explained, were sowed by parents and \"those about children.\" Id., at 29. Significantly, Locke did not suggest circumscribing parental authority but rather articulated a new basis for it. Rousseau disagreed with Locke in important respects, but his philosophy was similarly premised on parental control over a child\\'s development. Although Rousseau advocated that children should be allowed to develop naturally, he instructed that the environment be directed by \"a tutor who is given total control over the child and who removes him from society, from all competing sources of authority and influence.\" J. Fliegelman, Prodigals and Pilgrims 30 (1982) (hereinafter Fliegelman); see also Reinier 15.\\n\\nThese writings received considerable attention in America. Locke\\'s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and his Some Thoughts Concerning Education were significantly more popular than his Two Treatises of Government, according to a study of 92 colonial libraries between 1700 and 1776. Lundberg & May, The Enlightened Reader in America, 28 American Quarterly 262, 273 (1976) (hereinafter Lundberg). And Rousseau\\'s Emile, a treatise on education, was more widely advertised and distributed than his political work, The Social Contract. Fliegelman 29; see also Lundberg 285. In general, the most popular books in the Colonies on the eve of the American Revolution were not political discourses but ones concerned with child rearing. See Mintz & Kellogg 45.2Locke\\'s and Rousseau\\'s writings fostered a new conception of childhood. Children were increasingly viewed as malleable creatures, and childhood came to be seen as an important period of growth, development, and preparation for adulthood. See Mintz & Kellogg 17, 21, 47; M. Grossberg, Governing the Hearth 8 (1985) (hereinafter Grossberg). Noah Webster, called the father of American education, wrote that \"[t]he impressions received in early life usually form the characters of individuals.\" On the Education of Youth in America (1790) (hereinafter Webster), in Essays on Education in the Early Republic 43 (F. Rudolph ed.1965) (hereinafter Rudolph); cf. Slater, Noah Webster: Founding Father of American Scholarship and Education, in Noah Webster\\'s First Edition of an American Dictionary of the English Language (1967). Elizabeth Smith, sister-in-law to John Adams, similarly wrote: \"The Infant Mind, I beleive[,] is a blank, that eassily receives any impression.\" M. Norton, Liberty\\'s Daughters 101 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted) (hereinafter Norton); see also S. Doggett, A Discourse on Education (1796) (hereinafter Doggett), in Rudolph 151 (\"[I]n early youth, . . . every power and capacity is pliable and susceptible of any direction or impression\"); J. Abbott, The Mother at Home 2 (1834) (hereinafter Abbott) (\"What impressions can be more strong, and more lasting, than those received upon the mind in the freshness and the susceptibility of youth\").\\n\\nChildren lacked reason and decisionmaking ability. They \"have not Judgment or Will of their own,\" John Adams noted. Letter to James Sullivan (May 26, 1776), in 4 Papers of John Adams 210 (R. Taylor ed.1979); see also Vol. 1 1787: Drafting the Constitution, p. 229 (W. Benton ed.1986) (quoting Gouvernor Morris in James Madison\\'s notes from the Constitutional Convention explaining that children do not vote because they \"want prudence\" and \"have no will of their own\"). Children\\'s \"utter incapacity\" rendered them \"almost wholly at the mercy of their Parents or Instructors for a set of habits to regulate their whole conduct through life.\" J. Burgh, Thoughts on Education 7 (1749) (hereinafter Burgh).\\n\\nThis conception of childhood led to great concern about influences on children. \"Youth are ever learning to do what they see others around them doing, and these imitations grow into habits.\" Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also B. Rush, A Plan for the Establishment of Public Schools (1786) (hereinafter Rush), in Rudolph 16 (\"The vices of young people are generally learned from each other\"); Webster, in Rudolph 58 (\"[C]hildren, artless and unsuspecting, resign their hearts to any person whose manners are agreeable and whose conduct is respectable\"). Books therefore advised parents \"not to put children in the way of those whom you dare not trust.\" L. Child, The Mother\\'s Book 149 (1831) (hereinafter Child); see also S. Coontz, The Social Origins of Private Life 149-150 (1988) (noting that it was \"considered dangerous to leave children to the supervision of servants or apprentices\").\\n\\nAs a result, it was widely accepted that children needed close monitoring and carefully planned development. See B. Wishy, The Child and the Republic 24-25, 32 (1968) (hereinafter Wishy); Grossberg 8. Managing the young mind was considered \"infinitely important.\" Doggett, in Rudolph 151; see also A. MacLeod, A Moral Tale 72-73 (1975) (hereinafter MacLeod). In an essay on the education of youth in America, Noah Webster described the human mind as \"a rich field, which, without constant care, will ever be covered with a luxuriant growth of weeds.\" Rudolph 54. He advocated sheltering children from \"every low-bred, drunken, immoral character\" and keeping their minds \"untainted till their reasoning faculties have acquired strength and the good principles which may be planted in their minds have taken deep root.\" Id., at 63; see also Rush, in id., at 16 (\"[T]he most useful citizens have  been formed from those youth who have never known or felt their own wills till they were one and twenty years of age\"); Burgh 7 (\"[T]he souls of Youth are more immediately committed to the care of Parents and Instructors than even those of a People are to their Pastor\").\\n\\nThe Revolution only amplified these concerns. The Republic would require virtuous citizens, which necessitated proper training from childhood. See Mintz 54, 71; MacLeod 40; Saxton, French and American Childhoods, in Children and Youth in a New Nation 69 (J. Marten ed.2009) (hereinafter Marten); see also W. Cardell, Story of Jack Halyard, pp. xv-xvi (30th ed. 1834) (hereinafter Cardell) (\"[T]he glory and efficacy of our institutions will soon rest with those who are growing up to succede us\"). Children were \"the pivot of the moral world,\" and their proper development was \"a subject of as high interest, as any to which the human mind ha[d] ever been called.\" Id., at xvi.3Based on these views of childhood, the founding generation understood parents to have a right and duty to govern their children\\'s growth. Parents were expected to direct the development and education of their children and ensure that bad habits did not take root. See Calvert 58-59; MacLeod 72; Mintz & Kellogg 23. They were responsible for instilling \"moral prohibitions, behavioral standards, and a capacity for self-government that would prepare a child for the outside world.\" Mintz & Kellogg 58; see also Youth\\'s Companion, Apr. 16, 1827, p. 1 (hereinafter Youth\\'s Companion) (\"Let [children\\'s] minds be formed, their hearts prepared, and their characters moulded for the scenes and the duties of a brighter day\"). In short, \"[h]ome and family bore the major responsibility for the moral training of children and thus, by implication, for the moral health of the nation.\" MacLeod 29; see also Introduction, in Marten 6; Reinier, p. xi; Smith, Autonomy and Affection: Parents and Children in Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake Families, in Growing up in America 54 (N. Hiner & J. Hawes eds. 1985).\\n\\nThis conception of parental rights and duties was exemplified by Thomas Jefferson\\'s approach to raising children. He wrote letters to his daughters constantly and often gave specific instructions about what the children should do. See, e.g., Letter to Martha Jefferson (Nov. 28, 1783), in S. Randolph, The Domestic Life of Thomas Jefferson 44 (1939) (dictating her daily schedule of music, dancing, drawing, and studying); Letter to Martha Jefferson (Dec. 22, 1783), in id., at 45-46 (\"I do not wish you to be gaily clothed at this time of life . . . . [A]bove all things and at all times let your clothes be neat, whole, and properly put on\"). Jefferson expected his daughter, Martha, to write \"by every post\" and instructed her, \"Inform me what books you read [and] what tunes you learn.\" Letter (Nov. 28, 1783), in id., at 44. He took the same approach with his nephew, Peter Carr, after Carr\\'s father died. See Letter (Aug. 19, 1785), in 8 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 405-408 (J. Boyd ed.1953) (detailing a course of reading and exercise, and asking for monthly progress reports describing \"in what manner you employ every hour in the day\"); see also 3 Dictionary of Virginia Biography 29 (2006).\\n\\nJefferson\\'s rigorous management of his charges was not uncommon. \"[M]uch evidence indicates that mothers and fathers both believed in giving their children a strict upbringing, enforcing obedience to their commands and stressing continued subjection to the parental will.\" Norton 96. Two parenting books published in the 1830\\'s gave prototypical advice. In The Mother\\'s Book, Lydia Child advised that \"[t]he first and most important step in management is, that whatever a mother says, always must be done.\" Child 26. John Abbott, the author of The Mother at Home, likewise advised that \"[o]bedience is absolutely essential to proper family government.\" Abbott 18. Echoing Locke, Abbott warned that parents who indulged a child\\'s \"foolish and unreasonable wishes\" would doom that child to be indulgent in adulthood. Id., at 16.\\n\\nThe concept of total parental control over children\\'s lives extended into the schools. \"The government both of families and schools should be absolute,\" declared Noah Webster. Rudolph 57-58. Dr. Benjamin Rush concurred: \"In the education of youth, let the authority of our masters be as absolute as possible.\" Id., at 16. Through the doctrine of in loco parentis, teachers assumed the \"`sacred dut[y] of parents . . . to train up and qualify their children\\'\" and exercised the same authority \"`to command obedience, to control stubbornness, to quicken diligence, and to reform bad habits.\\'\" Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 413-414, 127 S.Ct. 2618, 168 L.Ed.2d 290 (2007) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (quoting State v. Pendergrass, 19 N.C. 365, 365-366 (1837)); see also Wishy 73. Thus, the quality of teachers and schools had to \"be watched with the most scrupulous attention.\" Webster, in Rudolph 64.\\n\\nFor their part, children were expected to be dutiful and obedient. Mintz & Kellogg 53; Wishy 31; cf. J. Kett, Rites of Passage 45 (1977). Schoolbooks instructed children to do so and frequently featured vignettes illustrating the consequences of disobedience. See Adams, \"Pictures of the Vicious ultimately overcome by misery and shame\": The Cultural Work of Early National Schoolbooks (hereinafter Adams), in Marten 156. One oft-related example was the hangings of 19 alleged witches in 1692, which, the schoolbooks noted, likely began with false complaints by two young girls. See J. Morse, The American Geography 191 (1789); see also Adams, in Marten 164.\\n\\nAn entire genre of books, \"loosely termed `advice to youth,\\'\" taught similar lessons well into the 1800\\'s. J. Demos, Circles and Lines: The Shape of Life in Early America 73 (2004); cf. Wishy 54. \"Next to your duty to God,\" advised one book, \"is your duty to your parents\" even if the child did not \"understand the reason of their commands.\" L. Sigourney, The Girl\\'s Reading Book 44 (14th ed. 1843); see also Filial Duty Recommended and Enforced, Introduction, p. iii (c. 1798); The Parent\\'s Present 44 (3d ed. 1841). \"Disobedience is generally punished in some way or other,\" warned another, \"and often very severely.\" S. Goodrich, Peter Parley\\'s Book of Fables 43 (1836); see also The Country School-House 27 (1848) (\"[T]he number of children who die from the effects of disobedience to their parents is very large\").4Society\\'s concern with children\\'s development extended to the books they read. \"Vice always spreads by being published,\" Noah Webster observed. Rudolph 62. \"[Y]oung people are taught many vices by fiction, books, or public exhibitions, vices which they never would have known had they never read such books or attended such public places.\" Ibid.; see also Cardell, p. xii (cautioning parents that \"[t]he first reading lessons for children have an extensive influence on the acquisitions and habits of future years\"); Youth\\'s Companion 1 (\"[T]he capacities of children, and the peculiar situation and duties of youth, require select and appropriate reading\"). Prominent children\\'s authors harshly criticized  fairy tales and the use of anthropomorphic animals. See, e.g., S. Goodrich, 2 Recollections of a Lifetime 320, n.* (1856) (describing fairy tales as \"calculated to familiarize the mind with things shocking and monstrous; to cultivate a taste for tales of bloodshed and violence; to teach the young to use coarse language, and cherish vulgar ideas; . . . and to fill [the youthful mind] with the horrors of a debased and debauched fancy\"); 1 id., at 167 (recalling that children\\'s books were \"full of nonsense\" and \"lies\"); Cardell, p. xiv (\"The fancy of converting inferior animals into `teachers of children,\\' has been carried to ridiculous extravagance\"); see also MacDonald 83, 103 (noting that fables and works of fantasy were not popular in America in the 1700\\'s).\\n\\nAdults carefully controlled what they published for children. Stories written for children were dedicated to moral instruction and were relatively austere, lacking details that might titillate children\\'s minds. See MacLeod 24-25, 42-48; see also id., at 42 (\"The authors of juvenile fiction imposed the constraints upon themselves in the name of duty, and for the sake of giving children what they thought children should have, although they were often well aware that children might prefer more exciting fare\"); Francis, American Children\\'s Literature, 1646-1880, in American Childhood 208-209 (J. Hawes & N. Hiner eds. 1985). John Newbery, the publisher often credited with creating the genre of children\\'s literature, removed traditional folk characters, like Tom Thumb, from their original stories and placed them in new morality tales in which good children were rewarded and disobedient children punished. Reinier 12.\\n\\nParents had total authority over what their children read. See A. MacLeod, American Childhood 177 (1994) (\"Ideally, if not always actually, nineteenth-century parents regulated their children\\'s lives fully, certainly including their reading\"). Lydia Child put it bluntly in The Mother\\'s Book: \"Children . . . should not read anything without a mother\\'s knowledge and sanction; this is particularly necessary between the ages of twelve and sixteen.\" Child 92; see also id., at 143 (\"[P]arents, or some guardian friends, should carefully examine every volume they put into the hands of young people\"); E. Monaghan, Learning to Read and Write in Colonial America 337 (2005) (reviewing a 12-year-old girl\\'s journal from the early 1770\\'s and noting that the child\\'s aunts monitored and guided her reading).5The law at the time reflected the founding generation\\'s understanding of parent-child relations. According to Sir William Blackstone, parents were responsible for maintaining, protecting, and education their children, and therefore had \"power\" over their children. 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 434, 440 (1765); cf. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 712, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) (Blackstone\\'s Commentaries was \"a primary legal authority for 18th- and 19th-century American lawyers\"). Chancellor James Kent agreed. 2 Commentaries on American Law *189-*207. The law entitled parents to \"the custody of their [children],\" \"the value of th[e] [children\\'s] labor and services,\" and the \"right to the exercise of such discipline as may be requisite for the discharge of their sacred trust.\" Id., at *193, *203. Children, in turn, were charged with \"obedience and assistance during their own minority, and gratitude and reverance during the rest of their lives.\" Id., at *207.\\n\\nThus, in case after case, courts made clear that parents had a right to the child\\'s labor and services until the child reached majority. In 1810, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts explained, \"There is no question but that a father, who is entitled to the services of his minor son, and for whom he is obliged to provide, may, at the common law, assign those services to others, for a consideration to enure to himself.\" Day v. Everett, 7 Mass. 145, 147; see also Benson v. Remington, 2 Mass. 113, 115 (1806) (opinion of Parsons, C.J.) (\"The law is very well settled, that parents are under obligations to support their children, and that they are entitled to their earnings\"). Similarly, the Supreme Court of Judicature of New Hampshire noted that the right of parents to recover for the services of their child, while a minor, \"cannot be contested.\" Gale v. Parrot, 1 N.H. 28, 29 (1817). And parents could bring tort suits against those who knowingly enticed a minor away from them. See, e.g., Kirkpatrick v. Lockhart, 2 Brev. 276, 1809 WL 295 (S.C. Constitutional Ct. 1809); Jones v. Tevis, 14 Ky. 25, 4 Litt. 25 (1823).\\n\\nRelatedly, boys could not enlist in the military without parental consent. Many of those who did so during the Revolutionary War found, afterwards, that their fathers were entitled to their military wages. See Cox, Boy Soldiers of the American Revolution, in Marten 21-24. And after the war, minors who enlisted without parental consent in violation of federal law could find themselves returned home on writs of habeas corpus issued at their parents\\' request. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 24 F. Cas. 813 (No. 14,449) (CC Tenn. 1812); Commonwealth v. Callan, 6 Binn. 255 (Pa.1814) (per curiam).\\n\\nLaws also set age limits restricting marriage without parental consent. For example, from 1730 until at least 1849, Pennsylvania law required parental consent for the marriage of anyone under the age of 21. See 4 Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania 153 (J. Mitchell & H. Flanders eds. 1897) (hereinafter Pa. Stats. at Large); General Laws of Pennsylvania 82-83 (J. Dunlop 2d ed. 1849) (including the 1730 marriage law with no amendments); see also Perpetual Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 253 (1788), in The First Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (J. Cushing ed.1981). In general, \"[p]ost-Revolutionary marriage law assumed that below a certain age, children could . . . no[t] intellectually understand its significance.\" Grossberg 105.\\n\\nIndeed, the law imposed age limits on all manner of activities that required judgment and reason. Children could not vote, could not serve on juries, and generally could not be witnesses in criminal cases unless they were older than 14. See Brewer 43, 145, 148, 159. Nor could they swear loyalty to a State. See, e.g., 9 Pa. Stats. at Large 111 (1903 ed.). Early federal laws granting aliens the ability to become citizens provided that those under 21 were deemed citizens if their fathers chose to naturalize. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 26, 1790, 1 Stat. 104; Act of Jan. 29, 1795, ch. 20, 1 Stat. 415.CThe history clearly shows a founding generation that believed parents to have complete authority over their minor children and expected parents to direct the development of those children. The Puritan tradition in New England laid the foundation of American parental authority and duty. See MacDonald 6 (\"The Puritans are virtually the inventors of the family as we know it today\"). In the decades leading up to and following the Revolution, the conception of the child\\'s mind evolved but the duty and authority of parents remained. Indeed, society paid closer attention to potential influences on children than before. See Mintz 72 (\"By weakening  earlier forms of patriarchal authority, the Revolution enhanced the importance of childrearing and education in ensuring social stability\"). Teachers and schools came under scrutiny, and children\\'s reading material was carefully supervised. Laws reflected these concerns and often supported parental authority with the coercive power of the state.IIAIn light of this history, the Framers could not possibly have understood \"the freedom of speech\" to include an unqualified right to speak to minors. Specifically, I am sure that the founding generation would not have understood \"the freedom of speech\" to include a right to speak to children without going through their parents. As a consequence, I do not believe that laws limiting such speech—for example, by requiring parental consent to speak to a minor—\"abridg[e] the freedom of speech\" within the original meaning of the First Amendment.\\n\\nWe have recently noted that this Court does not have \"freewheeling authority to declare new categories of speech outside the scope of the First Amendment.\" Stevens, 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1586. But we also recognized that there may be \"some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected [and] have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.\" Ibid. In my opinion, the historical evidence here plainly reveals one such category.[2]BAdmittedly, the original public understanding of a constitutional provision does not always comport with modern sensibilities. See Morse, 551 U.S., at 419, 127 S.Ct. 2618 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (treating students \"as though it were still the 19th century would find little support today\"). It may also be inconsistent with precedent. See McDonald, 561 U.S., at ___-___, 130 S.Ct., at 3084-3086 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (rejecting the Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 21 L.Ed. 394 (1873), as inconsistent with the original public meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment).\\n\\nThis, however, is not such a case. Although much has changed in this country since the Revolution, the notion that parents have authority over their children and that the law can support that authority persists today. For example, at least some States make it a crime to lure or entice a minor away from the minor\\'s parent. See, e.g., Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 272(b)(1) (West 2008); Fla. Stat.  § 787.03 (2010). Every State in the Union still establishes a minimum age for marriage without parental or judicial consent. Cf. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 558, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (Appendix D to opinion of Court) (2005). Individuals less than 18 years old cannot enlist in the military without parental consent. 10 U.S.C. § 505(a). And minors remain subject to curfew laws across the country, see Brief for Louisiana et al. as Amici Curiae 16, and cannot unilaterally consent to most medical procedures, id., at 15.\\n\\nMoreover, there are many things minors today cannot do at all, whether they have parental consent or not. State laws set minimum ages for voting and jury duty. See Roper, supra, at 581-585, 125 S.Ct. 1183 (Appendixes B and C to opinion of Court). In California (the State at issue here), minors cannot drive for hire or drive a school bus, Cal. Veh.Code Ann. §§ 12515, 12516 (West 2010), purchase tobacco, Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 308(b) (West 2008), play bingo for money, § 326.5(e), or execute a will, Cal. Probate Code Ann. § 6220 (West 2009).\\n\\nMy understanding of \"the freedom of speech\" is also consistent with this Court\\'s precedents. To be sure, the Court has held that children are entitled to the protection of the First Amendment, see, e.g., Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212-213, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975), and the government may not unilaterally dictate what children can say or hear, see id., at 213-214, 95 S.Ct. 2268; Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 511, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). But this Court has never held, until today, that \"the freedom of speech\" includes a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors\\' parents. To the contrary, \"[i]t is well settled that a State or municipality can adopt more stringent controls on communicative materials available to youths than on those available to adults.\" Erznoznik, supra, at 212, 95 S.Ct. 2268; cf. post, at 2762-2763 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\\n\\nThe Court\\'s constitutional jurisprudence \"historically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children.\" Parham v. J. R., 442 U.S. 584, 602, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979). Under that case law, \"legislature[s][can] properly conclude that parents and others, teachers for example, who have . . . primary responsibility for children\\'s well-being are entitled to the support of laws designed to aid discharge of that responsibility.\" Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 639, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968); see also Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 635, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979) (opinion of Powell, J.) (\"[T]he State is entitled to adjust its legal system to account for children\\'s vulnerability and their needs for concern, . . . sympathy, and. . . paternal attention\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). This is because \"the tradition of parental authority is not inconsistent with our tradition of individual liberty; rather, the former is one of the basic presuppositions of the latter.\" Id., at 638, 99 S.Ct. 3035; id., at 638-639, 99 S.Ct. 3035 (\"Legal restrictions on minors, especially those supportive of the parental role, may be important to the child\\'s chances for the full growth and maturity that make eventual participation in a free society meaningful and rewarding\").IIIThe California law at issue here prohibits the sale or rental of \"violent video game[s]\" to minors, defined as anyone \"under 18 years of age.\" Cal. Civ.Code Ann. §§ 1746.1(a), 1746 (West 2009). A violation of the law is punishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. § 1746.3. Critically, the law does not prohibit adults from buying or renting violent video games for a minor or prohibit minors from playing such games. Cf. ante, at 2747 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment); post, at 2766-2767 (BREYER, J., dissenting). The law also does not restrict a \"minor\\'s parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian\" from selling or renting him a violent video game. § 1746.1(c).\\n\\nRespondents, associations of companies in the video game industry, brought a preenforcement challenge to California\\'s law, claiming that on its face the law violates the free speech rights of their members. The Court holds that video games are speech for purposes of the First Amendment and finds the statute facially unconstitutional. See ante, at 2742-2743, 2747-2751. I disagree.\\n\\nUnder any of this Court\\'s standards for a facial First Amendment challenge, this one must fail. The video game associations cannot show \"that no set of circumstances exists under which [the law] would be valid,\" \"that the statute lacks any plainly legitimate sweep,\" or that \"a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute\\'s plainly legitimate sweep.\" Stevens, 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1587 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even assuming that video games are speech, in most applications the California law does not implicate the First Amendment. All that the law does is prohibit the direct sale or rental of a violent video game to a minor by someone other than the minor\\'s parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian. Where a minor has a parent or guardian, as is usually true, the law does not prevent that minor from obtaining a violent video game with his parent\\'s or guardian\\'s help. In the typical case, the only speech affected is speech that bypasses a minor\\'s parent or guardian. Because such speech does not fall within \"the freedom of speech\" as originally understood, California\\'s law does not ordinarily implicate the First Amendment and is not facially unconstitutional.[3]\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n\"The freedom of speech,\" as originally understood, does not include a right to speak to minors without going through the minors\\' parents or guardians. Therefore, I cannot agree that the statute at issue is facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment.\\n\\nI respectfully dissent.Justice BREYER, dissenting.California imposes a civil fine of up to $1,000 upon any person who distributes a violent video game in California without labeling it \"18,\" or who sells or rents a labeled violent video game to a person under the age of 18. Representatives of the video game and software industries, claiming that the statute violates the First Amendment on its face, seek an injunction against its enforcement. Applying traditional First Amendment analysis, I would uphold the statute as constitutional on its face and would consequently reject the industries\\' facial challenge.IACalifornia\\'s statute defines a violent video game as: A game in which a player \"kill[s], maim[s], dismember[s], or sexually assault[s] an image of a human being,\"\\n\\nand[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find [the game] appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors,\"and[the game] is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors,\"andthe game, as a whole, ... lack[s] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\" Cal. Civ.Code Ann. § 1746(d)(1) (West 2009).The statute in effect forbids the sale of such a game to minors unless they are accompanied by a parent; it requires the makers of the game to affix a label identifying it as a game suitable only for those aged 18 and over; it exempts retailers from liability unless such a label is properly affixed to the game; and it imposes a civil fine of up to $1,000 upon a violator. See §§ 1746.1-1746.3.BA facial challenge to this statute based on the First Amendment can succeed only if \"a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute\\'s plainly legitimate sweep.\" United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. ___, ___, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 1587, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, it is more difficult to mount a facial First Amendment attack on a statute that seeks to regulate activity that involves action as well as speech. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 614-615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). Hence, I shall focus here upon an area within which I believe the State can legitimately apply its statute, namely sales to minors under the age of 17 (the age cutoff used by the industry\\'s own ratings system), of highly realistic violent video games, which a reasonable game maker would know meet the Act\\'s criteria. That area lies at the heart of the statute. I shall assume that the number of instances in which the State will enforce the statute within that area is comparatively large, and that the number outside that area (for example, sales to 17-year-olds) is comparatively small. And the activity the statute regulates combines speech with action (a virtual form of target practice).CIn determining whether the statute is unconstitutional, I would apply both this Court\\'s \"vagueness\" precedents and a strict form of First Amendment scrutiny. In doing so, the special First Amendment category I find relevant is not (as the Court claims) the category of \"depictions of violence,\" ante, at 2736, but rather the category of \"protection of children.\" This Court has held that the \"power of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults.\" Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 170, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944). And the \"`regulatio[n] of communication addressed to [children] need not conform to the requirements of the [F]irst [A]mendment in the same way as those applicable to adults.\\'\" Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 638, n. 6, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968) (quoting Emerson, Toward a General Theory of the First Amendment, 72 Yale L.J. 877, 939 (1963)).\\n\\nThe majority\\'s claim that the California statute, if upheld, would create a \"new categor[y] of unprotected speech,\" ante, at 2734, 2735, is overstated. No one here argues that depictions of violence, even extreme violence, automatically fall outside the First Amendment\\'s protective scope as, for example, do obscenity and  depictions of child pornography. We properly speak of categories of expression that lack protection when, like \"child pornography,\" the category is broad, when it applies automatically, and when the State can prohibit everyone, including adults, from obtaining access to the material within it. But where, as here, careful analysis must precede a narrower judicial conclusion (say, denying protection to a shout of \"fire\" in a crowded theater, or to an effort to teach a terrorist group how to peacefully petition the United Nations), we do not normally describe the result as creating a \"new category of unprotected speech.\" See Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919); Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2705, 177 L.Ed.2d 355 (2010).\\n\\nThus, in Stevens, after rejecting the claim that all depictions of animal cruelty (a category) fall outside the First Amendment\\'s protective scope, we went on to decide whether the particular statute at issue violates the First Amendment under traditional standards; and we held that, because the statute was overly broad, it was invalid. Similarly, here the issue is whether, applying traditional First Amendment standards, this statute does, or does not, pass muster.IIIn my view, California\\'s statute provides \"fair notice of what is prohibited,\" and consequently it is not impermissibly vague. United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008). Ginsberg explains why that is so. The Court there considered a New York law that forbade the sale to minors of apicture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion picture film, or similar visual representation or image of a person or portion of the human body which depicts nudity ...,\"thatpredominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors,\"andis patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors,\"andis utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.\" 390 U.S., at 646-647, 88 S.Ct. 1274.This Court upheld the New York statute in Ginsberg (which is sometimes unfortunately confused with a very different, earlier case, Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S.Ct. 942, 16 L.Ed.2d 31 (1966)). The five-Justice majority, in an opinion written by Justice Brennan, wrote that the statute was sufficiently clear. 390 U.S., at 643-645, 88 S.Ct. 1274. No Member of the Court voiced any vagueness objection. See id., at 648-650, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Stewart, J., concurring in result); id., at 650-671, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Douglas, J., joined by Black, J., dissenting); id., at 671-675, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Fortas, J., dissenting).\\n\\nComparing the language of California\\'s statute (set forth supra, at 2732-2733) with the language of New York\\'s statute (set forth immediately above), it is difficult to find any vagueness-related difference. Why are the words \"kill,\" \"maim,\" and \"dismember\" any more difficult to understand than the word \"nudity?\" Justice ALITO objects that these words do \"not perform the narrowing function\" that this Court has required in adult obscenity cases, where statutes can only cover \"`hard core\\'\" depictions. Ante, at 2744-2745 (opinion concurring in judgment). But the relevant comparison is not to adult obscenity cases but to Ginsberg, which dealt with \"nudity,\" a category no more \"narrow\" than killing and maiming. And in any event, narrowness and vagueness do not necessarily have anything to do with one another. All that is required for vagueness purposes is that the terms \"kill,\" \"maim,\" and \"dismember\" give fair notice as to what they cover, which they do.\\n\\nThe remainder of California\\'s definition copies, almost word for word, the language this Court used in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), in permitting a total ban on material that satisfied its definition (one enforced with criminal penalties). The California law\\'s reliance on \"community standards\" adheres to Miller, and in Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 57-58, 109 S.Ct. 916, 103 L.Ed.2d 34 (1989), this Court specifically upheld the use of Miller\\' s language against charges of vagueness. California only departed from the Miller formulation in two significant respects: It substituted the word \"deviant\" for the words \"prurient\" and \"shameful,\" and it three times added the words \"for minors.\" The word \"deviant\" differs from \"prurient\" and \"shameful,\" but it would seem no less suited to defining and narrowing the reach of the statute. And the addition of \"for minors\" to a version of the Miller standard was approved in Ginsberg, 390 U.S., at 643, 88 S.Ct. 1274, even though the New York law \"dr[ew] no distinction between young children and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority,\" ante, at 2746 (opinion of ALITO, J.).\\n\\nBoth the Miller standard and the law upheld in Ginsberg lack perfect clarity. But that fact reflects the difficulty of the Court\\'s long search for words capable of protecting expression without depriving the State of a legitimate constitutional power to regulate. As is well known, at one point Justice Stewart thought he could do no better in defining obscenity than, \"I know it when I see it.\" Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 197, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964) (concurring opinion). And Justice Douglas dissented from Miller\\'s standard, which he thought was still too vague. 413 U.S., at 39-40, 93 S.Ct. 2607. Ultimately, however, this Court accepted the \"community standards\" tests used in Miller and Ginsberg. They reflect the fact that sometimes, even when a precise standard proves elusive, it is easy enough to identify instances that fall within a legitimate regulation. And they seek to draw a line, which, while favoring free expression, will nonetheless permit a legislature to find the words necessary to accomplish a legitimate constitutional objective. Cf. Williams, supra, at 304, 128 S.Ct. 1830 (the Constitution does not always require \"`perfect clarity and precise guidance,\\'\" even when \"`expressive activity\\'\" is involved).\\n\\nWhat, then, is the difference between Ginsberg and Miller on the one hand and the California law on the other? It will often be easy to pick out cases at which California\\'s statute directly aims, involving, say, a character who shoots out a police officer\\'s knee, douses him with gasoline, lights him on fire, urinates on his burning body, and finally kills him with a gunshot to the head. (Footage of one such game sequence has been submitted in the record.) See also ante, at 2749-2750 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). As in Miller and Ginsberg, the California law clearly protects even the most violent games that possess serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. § 1746(d)(1)(A)(iii). And it is easier here than in Miller or Ginsberg to separate the sheep from the goats at the statute\\'s border. That is because here the industry itself has promulgated standards and created a review process, in which adults who \"typically have experience with children\" assess what games are inappropriate for minors. See Entertainment Software Rating Board, Rating Process, online at http:// www.esrb.org/ratings/ & ratings_ process.jsp (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\\'s case file).\\n\\nThere is, of course, one obvious difference: The Ginsberg statute concerned depictions of \"nudity,\" while California\\'s statute concerns extremely violent video games. But for purposes of vagueness, why should that matter? Justice ALITO argues that the Miller standard sufficed because there are \"certain generally accepted norms concerning expression related to sex,\" whereas there are no similarly \"accepted standards regarding the suitability of violent entertainment.\" Ante, at 2745. But there is no evidence that is so. The Court relied on \"community standards\" in Miller precisely because of the difficulty of articulating \"accepted norms\" about depictions of sex. I can find no difference—historical or otherwise—that is relevant to the vagueness question. Indeed, the majority\\'s examples of literary descriptions of violence, on which Justice ALITO relies, do not show anything relevant at all.\\n\\nAfter all, one can find in literature as many (if not more) descriptions of physical love as descriptions of violence. Indeed, sex \"has been a theme in art and literature throughout the ages.\" Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 246, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002). For every Homer, there is a Titian. For every Dante, there is an Ovid. And for all the teenagers who have read the original versions of Grimm\\'s Fairy Tales, I suspect there are those who know the story of Lady Godiva.\\n\\nThus, I can find no meaningful vagueness-related differences between California\\'s law and the New York law upheld in Ginsberg. And if there remain any vagueness problems, the state courts can cure them through interpretation. See Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 216, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975) (\"[S]tate statute should not be deemed facially invalid unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts\"). Cf. Ginsberg, supra, at 644, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (relying on the fact that New York Court of Appeals would read a knowledge requirement into the statute); Berry v. Santa Barbara, 40 Cal.App.4th 1075, 1088-1089, 47 Cal.Rptr.2d 661, 669 (1995) (reading a knowledge requirement into a statute). Consequently, for purposes of this facial challenge, I would not find the statute unconstitutionally vague.IIIVideo games combine physical action with expression. Were physical activity to predominate in a game, government could appropriately intervene, say by requiring parents to accompany children when playing a game involving actual target practice, or restricting the sale of toys presenting physical dangers to children. See generally Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, 122 Stat. 3016 (\"Title I— Children\\'s Product Safety\"). But because video games also embody important expressive and artistic elements, I agree with the Court that the First Amendment significantly limits the State\\'s power to regulate. And I would determine whether the State has exceeded those limits by applying a strict standard of review.\\n\\nLike the majority, I believe that the California law must be \"narrowly tailored\" to further a \"compelling interest,\" without there being a \"less restrictive\" alternative that would be \"at least as effective.\" Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 874, 875, 879, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997). I would not apply this strict standard \"mechanically.\" United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 841, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000) (BREYER, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O\\'Connor and SCALIA, JJ., dissenting). Rather, in applying it, I would evaluate the degree to which the statute injures speech-related interests, the nature of the potentially-justifying \"compelling interests,\" the degree to which the statute furthers that interest, the nature and effectiveness of possible alternatives, and, in light of this evaluation, whether, overall, \"the statute works speech-related harm ... out of proportion to the benefits that the statute seeks to provide.\" Ibid. See also Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 210, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992) (plurality opinion) (applying strict scrutiny and finding relevant the lack of a \"significant impingement\" on speech).\\n\\nFirst Amendment standards applied in this way are difficult but not impossible to satisfy. Applying \"strict scrutiny\" the Court has upheld restrictions on speech that, for example, ban the teaching of peaceful dispute resolution to a group on the State Department\\'s list of terrorist organizations, Holder, 561 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 2723-3730; but cf. id., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 2731 (BREYER, J., dissenting), and limit speech near polling places, Burson, supra, at 210-211, 112 S.Ct. 1846 (plurality opinion). And applying less clearly defined but still rigorous standards, the Court has allowed States to require disclosure of petition signers, Doe v. Reed, 561 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2811, 177 L.Ed.2d 493 (2010), and to impose campaign contribution limits that were \"`closely drawn\\' to match a `sufficiently important interest,\\'\" Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 387-388, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000).\\n\\nMoreover, although the Court did not specify the \"level of scrutiny\" it applied in Ginsberg, we have subsequently described that case as finding a \"compelling interest\" in protecting children from harm sufficient to justify limitations on speech. See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989). Since the Court in Ginsberg specified that the statute\\'s prohibition applied to material that was not obscene, 390 U.S., at 634, 88 S.Ct. 1274, I cannot dismiss Ginsberg on the ground that it concerned obscenity. But cf. ante, at 2735 (majority opinion). Nor need I depend upon the fact that the Court in Ginsberg insisted only that the legislature have a \"rational\" basis for finding the depictions there at issue harmful to children. 390 U.S., at 639, 88 S.Ct. 1274. For in this case, California has substantiated its claim of harm with considerably stronger evidence.ACalifornia\\'s law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression. The statute prevents no one from playing a video game, it prevents no adult from buying a video game, and it prevents no child or adolescent from obtaining a game provided a parent is willing to help. § 1746.1(c). All it prevents is a child or adolescent from buying, without a parent\\'s assistance, a gruesomely violent video game of a kind that the industry itself tells us it wants to keep out of the hands of those under the age of 17. See Brief for Respondents 8.\\n\\nNor is the statute, if upheld, likely to create a precedent that would adversely affect other media, say films, or videos, or books. A typical video game involves a significant amount of physical activity. See ante, at 2748-2749 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (citing examples of the increasing interactivity of video game controllers). And pushing buttons that achieve an interactive, virtual form of target practice (using images of human beings as targets), while containing an expressive component, is not just like watching a typical movie. See infra, at 2768-2769.BThe interest that California advances in support of the statute is compelling. As this Court has previously described that interest, it consists of both (1) the \"basic\" parental claim \"to authority in their own household to direct the rearing of their children,\" which makes it proper to enact \"laws designed to aid discharge of [parental] responsibility,\" and (2) the State\\'s \"independent interest in the well-being of its youth.\" Ginsberg, 390 U.S., at 639-640, 88 S.Ct. 1274. Cf. id., at 639, n. 7, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (\"`[O]ne can well distinguish laws which do not impose a morality on children, but which support the right of parents to deal with the morals of their children as they see fit\\'\" (quoting Henkin, Morals and the Constitution: The Sin of Obscenity, 63 Colum. L.Rev. 391, 413, n. 68 (1963))). And where these interests work in tandem, it is not fatally \"underinclusive\" for a State to advance its interests in protecting children against the special harms present in an interactive video game medium through a default rule that still allows parents to provide their children with what their parents wish.\\n\\nBoth interests are present here. As to the need to help parents guide their children, the Court noted in 1968 that \"`parental control or guidance cannot always be provided.\\'\" 390 U.S., at 640, 88 S.Ct. 1274. Today, 5.3 million grade-school-age children of working parents are routinely home alone. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, Who\\'s Minding the Kids? Child Care Arrangements: Spring 2005/Summer 2006, p. 12 (2010), online at http:// www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p70-121.pdf. Thus, it has, if anything, become more important to supplement parents\\' authority to guide their children\\'s development.\\n\\nAs to the State\\'s independent interest, we have pointed out that juveniles are more likely to show a \"`lack of maturity\\'\" and are \"more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures,\" and that their \"character ... is not as well formed as that of an adult.\" Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 569-570, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). And we have therefore recognized \"a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors.\" Sable Communications, supra, at 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829.\\n\\nAt the same time, there is considerable evidence that California\\'s statute significantly furthers this compelling interest. That is, in part, because video games are excellent teaching tools. Learning a practical task often means developing habits, becoming accustomed to performing the task, and receiving positive reinforcement when performing that task well. Video games can help develop habits, accustom the player to performance of the task, and reward the player for performing that task well. Why else would the Armed Forces incorporate video games into its training? See CNN, War Games: Military Training Goes High-Tech (Nov. 22, 2001), online at http://articles.cnn.com / 2001-11-2 / tech /2war.games_1_ictbill-swartout-real-world-training?_s=PM:TECH.\\n\\nWhen the military uses video games to help soldiers train for missions, it is using this medium for a beneficial purpose. But California argues that when the teaching features of video games are put to less desirable ends, harm can ensue. In particular, extremely violent games can harm children by rewarding them for being violently aggressive in play, and thereby often teaching them to be violently aggressive in life. And video games can cause more harm in this respect than can typically passive media, such as books or films or television programs.\\n\\nThere are many scientific studies that support California\\'s views. Social scientists, for example, have found causal evidence that playing these games results in harm. Longitudinal studies, which measure changes over time, have found that increased exposure to violent video games causes an increase in aggression over the same period. See Möller & Krahe, Exposure to Violent Video Games and Aggression in German Adolescents: A Longitudinal Analysis, 35 Aggressive Behavior 75 (2009); Gentile & Gentile, Violent Video Games as Exemplary Teachers: A Conceptual Analysis, 37 J. Youth & Adolescence 127 (2008); Anderson et al., Longitudinal Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggression in Japan and the United States, 122 Pediatrics e1067 (2008); Wallenius & Punamuki, Digital Game Violence and Direct Aggression in Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study of the Roles of Sex, Age, and Parent-Child Communication, 29 J. Applied Developmental Psychology 286 (2008).\\n\\nExperimental studies in laboratories have found that subjects randomly assigned to play a violent video game subsequently displayed more characteristics of aggression than those who played nonviolent games. See, e.g., Anderson et al., Violent Video Games: Specific Effects of Violent Content on Aggressive Thoughts and Behavior, 36 Advances in Experimental Soc. Psychology 199 (2004).\\n\\nSurveys of 8th and 9th grade students have found a correlation between playing violent video games and aggression. See, e.g., Gentile, Lynch, Linder, & Walsh, The Effects of Violent Video Game Habits On Adolescent Hostility, Aggressive Behaviors, and School Performance, 27 J. Adolescence 5 (2004).\\n\\nCutting-edge neuroscience has shown that \"virtual violence in video game playing results in those neural patterns that are considered characteristic for aggressive cognition and behavior.\" Weber, Ritterfeld, & Mathiak, Does Playing Violent Video Games Induce Aggression? Empirical Evidence of a Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study, 8 Media Psychology 39, 51 (2006).\\n\\nAnd \"meta-analyses,\" i.e., studies of all the studies, have concluded that exposure to violent video games \"was positively associated with aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect,\" and that \"playing violent video games is a causal risk factor for long-term harmful outcomes.\" Anderson et al., Violent Video Game Effects on Aggression, Empathy, and Prosocial Behavior in Eastern and Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review, 136 Psychological Bulletin 151, 167, 169 (2010) (emphasis added).\\n\\nSome of these studies take care to explain in a commonsense way why video games are potentially more harmful than, say, films or books or television. In essence, they say that the closer a child\\'s behavior comes, not to watching, but to acting out horrific violence, the greater the potential psychological harm. See Bushman & Huesmann, Aggression, in 2 Handbook of Social Pscyhology 833, 851 (S. Fiske, D. Gilbert, & G. Lindzey eds., 5th ed.2010) (video games stimulate more aggression because \"[p]eople learn better when they are actively involved,\" players are \"more likely to identify with violent characters,\" and \"violent games directly reward violent behavior\"); Polman, de Castro, & van Aken, Experimental Study of the Differential Effects of Playing Versus Watching Violent Video Games on Children\\'s Aggressive Behavior, 34 Aggressive Behavior 256 (2008) (finding greater aggression resulting from playing, as opposed to watching, a violent game); C. Anderson, D. Gentile, & K. Buckley, Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adolescents 136-137 (2007) (three studies finding greater effects from games as opposed to television). See also infra, at 2769-2770 (statements of expert public health associations agreeing that interactive games can be more harmful than \"passive\" media like television); ante, at 2748-2751 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment).\\n\\nExperts debate the conclusions of all these studies. Like many, perhaps most, studies of human behavior, each study has its critics, and some of those critics have produced studies of their own in which they reach different conclusions. (I list both sets of research in the appendixes.) I, like most judges, lack the social science expertise to say definitively who is right. But associations of public health professionals who do possess that expertise have reviewed many of these studies and found a significant risk that violent video games, when compared with more passive media, are particularly likely to cause children harm.\\n\\nEleven years ago, for example, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Psychiatric Association released a joint statement, which said:[O]ver 1000 studies ... point overwhelmingly to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children ... [and, though less research had been done at that time, preliminary studies indicated that] the impact of violent interactive entertainment (video games and other interactive media) on young people ... may be significantly more severe than that wrought by television, movies, or music.\" Joint Statement on the Impact of Entertainment Violence on Children (2000) (emphasis added), online at http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/jstmtevc.htm.Five years later, after more research had been done, the American Psychological Association adopted a resolution that said:[C]omprehensive analysis of violent interactive video game research suggests such exposure ... increases aggressive behavior, ... increases aggressive thoughts, ... increases angry feelings,... decreases helpful behavior, and ... increases physiological arousal.\" Resolution on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media (2005), online at http://ww.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/interactive-media.pdf.The Association added:[T]he practice, repetition, and rewards for acts of violence may be more conducive to increasing aggressive behavior among children and youth than passively watching violence on TV and in films.\" Ibid. (emphasis added).Four years after that, in 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement in significant part about interactive media. It said:Studies of these rapidly growing and ever-more-sophisticated types of media have indicated that the effects of child-initiated virtual violence may be even more profound than those of passive media such as television. In many games the child or teenager is `embedded\\' in the game and uses a `joystick\\' (handheld controller) that enhances both the experience and the aggressive feelings.\" Policy Statement—Media Violence, 124 Pediatrics 1495, 1498 (2009) (emphasis added).It added:Correlational and experimental studies have revealed that violent video games lead to increases in aggressive behavior and aggressive thinking and decreases in prosocial behavior. Recent longitudinal studies ... have revealed that in as little as 3 months, high exposure to violent video games increased physical aggression. Other recent longitudinal studies ... have revealed similar effects across 2 years.\" Ibid. (footnotes omitted).Unlike the majority, I would find sufficient grounds in these studies and expert opinions for this Court to defer to an elected legislature\\'s conclusion that the video games in question are particularly likely to harm children. This Court has always thought it owed an elected legislature some degree of deference in respect to legislative facts of this kind, particularly when they involve technical matters that are beyond our competence, and even in First Amendment cases. See Holder, 561 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 2726-2727 (deferring, while applying strict scrutiny, to the Government\\'s national security judgments); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. 180, 195-196, 117 S.Ct. 1174, 137 L.Ed.2d 369 (1997) (deferring, while applying intermediate scrutiny, to the Government\\'s technological judgments). The majority, in reaching its own, opposite conclusion about the validity of the relevant studies, grants the legislature no deference at all. Compare ante, at 2738-2739 (stating that the studies do not provide evidence that violent video games \"cause\" harm (emphasis deleted)), with supra, at 2767-2768 (citing longitudinal studies finding causation).CI can find no \"less restrictive\" alternative to California\\'s law that would be \"at least as effective.\" See Reno, 521 U.S., at 874, 117 S.Ct. 2329. The majority points to a voluntary alternative: The industry tries to prevent those under 17 from buying extremely violent games by labeling those games with an \"M\" (Mature) and encouraging retailers to restrict their sales to those 17 and older. See ante, at 2740-2741. But this voluntary system has serious enforcement gaps. When California enacted its law, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) study had found that nearly 70% of unaccompanied 13- to 16-year-olds were able to buy M-rated video games. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 27 (2004), online at http://www. ftc.gov/os/2004/ 07/040708kidsviolencerpt. pdf. Subsequently the voluntary program has become more effective. But as of the FTC\\'s most recent update to Congress, 20% of those under 17 are still able to buy M-rated video games, and, breaking down sales by store, one finds that this number rises to nearly 50% in the case of one large national chain. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 28 (2009), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/12/ P994511violententertainment.pdf. And the industry could easily revert back to the substantial noncompliance that existed in 2004, particularly after today\\'s broad ruling reduces the industry\\'s incentive to police itself.\\n\\nIVThe upshot is that California\\'s statute, as applied to its heartland of applications (i.e., buyers under 17; extremely violent, realistic video games), imposes a restriction on speech that is modest at most. That restriction is justified by a compelling interest (supplementing parents\\' efforts to prevent their children from purchasing potentially harmful violent, interactive material). And there is no equally effective, less restrictive alternative. California\\'s statute is consequently constitutional on its face—though litigants remain free to challenge the statute as applied in particular instances, including any effort by the State to apply it to minors aged 17.\\n\\nI add that the majority\\'s different conclusion creates a serious anomaly in First Amendment law. Ginsberg makes clear that a State can prohibit the sale to minors of depictions of nudity; today the Court makes clear that a State cannot prohibit the sale to minors of the most violent interactive video games. But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13-year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her? What kind of First Amendment would permit the government to protect children by restricting sales of that extremely violent video game only when the woman—bound, gagged, tortured, and killed—is also topless?\\n\\nThis anomaly is not compelled by the First Amendment. It disappears once one recognizes that extreme violence, where interactive, and without literary, artistic, or similar justification, can prove at least as, if not more, harmful to children as photographs of nudity. And the record here is more than adequate to support such a view. That is why I believe that Ginsberg controls the outcome here a fortiori. And it is why I believe California\\'s law is constitutional on its face.\\n\\nThis case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education. Our Constitution cannot succeed in securing the liberties it seeks to protect unless we can raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work. Education, however, is about choices. Sometimes, children need to learn by making choices for themselves. Other times, choices are made for children—by their parents, by their teachers, and by the people acting democratically through their governments. In my view, the First Amendment does not disable government from helping parents make such a choice here—a choice not to have their children buy extremely violent, interactive video games, which they more than reasonably fear pose only the risk of harm to those children.\\n\\nFor these reasons, I respectfully dissent.FOOTNOTES[1] Justice ALITO distinguishes Stevens on several grounds that seem to us ill founded. He suggests, post, at 2747 (opinion concurring in judgment), that Stevens did not apply strict scrutiny. If that is so (and we doubt it), it would make this an a fortiori case. He says, post, at 2746-2747, 2747, that the California Act punishes the sale or rental rather than the \"creation\" or \"possession\" of violent depictions. That distinction appears nowhere in Stevens itself, and for good reason: It would make permissible the prohibition of printing or selling books—though not the writing of them. Whether government regulation applies to creating, distributing, or consuming speech makes no difference. And finally, Justice ALITO points out, post, at 2747, that Stevens \"left open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute\" would be constitutional. True, but entirely irrelevant. Stevens said, 559 U.S., at ___, 130 S.Ct., at 1592, that the \"crush-video\" statute at issue there might pass muster if it were limited to videos of acts of animal cruelty that violated the law where the acts were performed. There is no contention that any of the virtual characters depicted in the imaginative videos at issue here are criminally liable.\\n\\n[2] The statute in Ginsberg restricted the sale of certain depictions of \"nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sado-masochistic abuse,\" that were \"`[h]armful to minors.\\'\" A depiction was harmful to minors if it:\\n\\n\"(i) predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interests of minors, and\\n\\n\"(ii) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors, and\\n\\n\"(iii) is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.\" 390 U.S., at 646, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court) (quoting N.Y. Penal Law § 484-h(1)(f)).\\n\\n[3] Justice THOMAS ignores the holding of Erznoznik, and denies that persons under 18 have any constitutional right to speak or be spoken to without their parents\\' consent. He cites no case, state or federal, supporting this view, and to our knowledge there is none. Most of his dissent is devoted to the proposition that parents have traditionally had the power to control what their children hear and say. This is true enough. And it perhaps follows from this that the state has the power to enforce parental prohibitions—to require, for example, that the promoters of a rock concert exclude those minors whose parents have advised the promoters that their children are forbidden to attend. But it does not follow that the state has the power to prevent children from hearing or saying anything without their parents\\' prior consent. The latter would mean, for example, that it could be made criminal to admit persons under 18 to a political rally without their parents\\' prior written consent—even a political rally in support of laws against corporal punishment of children, or laws in favor of greater rights for minors. And what is good for First Amendment rights of speech must be good for First Amendment rights of religion as well: It could be made criminal to admit a person under 18 to church, or to give a person under 18 a religious tract, without his parents\\' prior consent. Our point is not, as Justice THOMAS believes, post, at 2759, n. 2, merely that such laws are \"undesirable.\" They are obviously an infringement upon the religious freedom of young people and those who wish to proselytize young people. Such laws do not enforce parental authority over children\\'s speech and religion; they impose governmental authority, subject only to a parental veto. In the absence of any precedent for state control, uninvited by the parents, over a child\\'s speech and religion (Justice THOMAS cites none), and in the absence of any justification for such control that would satisfy strict scrutiny, those laws must be unconstitutional. This argument is not, as Justice THOMAS asserts, \"circular,\" ibid. It is the absence of any historical warrant or compelling justification for such restrictions, not our ipse dixit, that renders them invalid.\\n\\n[4] Justice ALITO accuses us of pronouncing that playing violent video games \"is not different in `kind\\'\" from reading violent literature. Post, at 2742. Well of course it is different in kind, but not in a way that causes the provision and viewing of violent video games, unlike the provision and reading of books, not to be expressive activity and hence not to enjoy First Amendment protection. Reading Dante is unquestionably more cultured and intellectually edifying than playing Mortal Kombat. But these cultural and intellectual differences are not constitutional ones. Crudely violent video games, tawdry TV shows, and cheap novels and magazines are no less forms of speech than The Divine Comedy, and restrictions upon them must survive strict scrutiny—a question to which we devote our attention in Part III, infra. Even if we can see in them \"nothing of any possible value to society . . ., they are as much entitled to the protection of free speech as the best of literature.\" Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 510, 68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840 (1948).\\n\\n[5] The crusade against comic books was led by a psychiatrist, Frederic Wertham, who told the Senate Judiciary Committee that \"as long as the crime comic books industry exists in its present forms there are no secure homes.\" Juvenile Delinquency (Comic Books): Hearings before the Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 84 (1954). Wertham\\'s objections extended even to Superman comics, which he described as \"particularly injurious to the ethical development of children.\" Id., at 86. Wertham\\'s crusade did convince the New York Legislature to pass a ban on the sale of certain comic books to minors, but it was vetoed by Governor Thomas Dewey on the ground that it was unconstitutional given our opinion in Winters, supra. See People v. Bookcase, Inc., 14 N.Y.2d 409, 412-413, 252 N.Y.S.2d 433, 201 N.E.2d 14, 15-16 (1964).\\n\\n[6] See Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger, 556 F.3d 950, 963-964 (C.A.9 2009); Interactive Digital Software Assn. v. St. Louis County, 329 F.3d 954 (C.A.8 2003); American Amusement Machine Assn. v.

App. 496, 506 (internal quotation marks omitted). The prevention of this phenomenon, which might have been anticipated with common sense, is not a compelling state interest.\\n\\n[8] Justice ALITO is mistaken in thinking that we fail to take account of \"new and rapidly evolving technology,\" post, at 2742. The studies in question pertain to that new and rapidly evolving technology, and fail to show, with the degree of certitude that strict scrutiny requires, that this subject-matter restriction on speech is justified. Nor is Justice ALITO correct in attributing to us the view that \"violent video games really present no serious problem.\" Post, at 2742. Perhaps they do present a problem, and perhaps none of us would allow our own children to play them. But there are all sorts of \"problems\"—some of them surely more serious than this one— that cannot be addressed by governmental restriction of free expression: for example, the problem of encouraging anti-Semitism (National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43, 97 S.Ct. 2205, 53 L.Ed.2d 96 (1977) (per curiam)), the problem of spreading a political philosophy hostile to the Constitution (Noto v. United States, 367 U.S. 290, 81 S.Ct. 1517, 6 L.Ed.2d 836 (1961)), or the problem of encouraging disrespect for the Nation\\'s flag (Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989)).\\n\\nJustice BREYER would hold that California has satisfied strict scrutiny based upon his own research into the issue of the harmfulness of violent video games. See post, at 2771-2779 (Appendixes to dissenting opinion) (listing competing academic articles discussing the harmfulness vel non of violent video games). The vast preponderance of this research is outside the record—and in any event we do not see how it could lead to Justice BREYER\\'s conclusion, since he admits he cannot say whether the studies on his side are right or wrong. Post, at 2769. Similarly, Justice ALITO says he is not \"sure\" whether there are any constitutionally dispositive differences between video games and other media. Post, at 2742-2743. If that is so, then strict scrutiny plainly has not been satisfied.\\n\\n[9] Justice BREYER concludes that the remaining gap is compelling because, according to the FTC\\'s report, some \"20% of those under 17 are still able to buy M-rated games.\" Post, at 2770 (citing FTC Report 28). But some gap in compliance is unavoidable. The sale of alcohol to minors, for example, has long been illegal, but a 2005 study suggests that about 18% of retailers still sell alcohol to those under the drinking age. Brief for State of Rhode Island et al. as Amici Curiae 18. Even if the sale of violent video games to minors could be deterred further by increasing regulation, the government does not have a compelling interest in each marginal percentage point by which its goals are advanced.ALITO CONCURRENCE FOOTNOTES[1] It is well established that a judgment may be affirmed on an alternative ground that was properly raised but not addressed by the lower court. Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U.S. 463, 478, n. 20, 99 S.Ct. 740, 58 L.Ed.2d 740 (1979).\\n\\n[2] Under the California law, a game that meets the threshold requirement set out in text also qualifies as \"violent\" if it \"[e]nables the player to virtually inflict serious injury upon images of human beings or characters with substantially human characteristics in a manner which is especially heinous, cruel, or depraved in that it involves torture or serious physical abuse to the victim.\" § 1746(d)(1)(B). In the Court of Appeals, California conceded that this alternative definition is unconstitutional, 556 F.3d 950, 954, n. 5 (C.A.9 2009), and therefore only the requirements set out in text are now before us.\\n\\n[3] The provision of New York law under which the petitioner was convicted in Ginsberg was framed with similar specificity. This provision applied to depictions of \"nudity\" and \"sexual conduct,\" and both those terms were specifically and unambiguously defined. See 390 U.S., at 645-647, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court).\\n\\n[4] The California law does not define the term \"maiming,\" nor has the State cited any decisions from its courts that define the term in this context. Accordingly, I take the term to have its ordinary meaning, which includes the infliction of any serious wound, see Webster\\'s Third New International Dictionary 1362 (2002) (hereinafter Webster\\'s).\\n\\n[5] At oral argument, California also proposed that the term \"minors\" could be interpreted as referring to the \"typical age group of minors\" who play video games. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. But nothing in the law\\'s text supports such a limitation. Nor has California cited any decisions indicating that its courts would restrict the law in this way. And there is nothing in the record indicating what this age group might be.\\n\\n[6] A 2004 Federal Trade Commission Report showed that 69 percent of unaccompanied children ages 13 to 16 were able to buy M-rated games and that 56 percent of 13-year-olds were able to buy an M-rated game.

The question is not whether certain laws might make sense to judges or legislators today, but rather what the public likely understood \"the freedom of speech\" to mean when the First Amendment was adopted.

I believe it is clear that the founding public would not have understood \"the freedom of speech\" to include speech to minor children bypassing their parents.

      "rewrittenPrompt": "A drone view of a diverse scene that encompasses the themes within the song '23' by a well-known singer-songwriter. On one side, envision a young Caucasian boy sitting against an old stagecoach, shotgun propped nearby, reminiscent of his time at 21. In contrast, a shot of a slightly older South Asian man, approximately 24, passed out on the floor, representing the lyric 'sober by twenty-four'. Include a scene from the past; perhaps a Hispanic teenager laboring hard in Oklahoma's summer. Also, try to illustrate elements like a band playing in a bar, road trip scenes with the radio playing to signify younger, lively years. Lastly, infuse a sense of loss, symbolized by a bottle and two empty wine glasses.",

Also, include aspects representing wealth advancement, such as a cash machine dispensing money, a pantry shelf filled with expensive beverages, a person sipping a fizzy drink and dancing. Add in a car seat illuminated in a menacing way, suggesting a ransom situation.

Ness gave me a reason to pop\nSo I spoke on his dead daddy and how he in a box\nBattle 12 against a lost nigga in need of his pops\nOut in Detroit, he expected me to flee from the spot\nSame nigga who said he was skinny dipping with six bitches\nAye Ripley, do you believe it or not?\nBut my 13th battle is when I finally get a home game\nAgainst a nigga named T-Rex who couldn't protect his own chains\nHis man Mook was doing his own thing, talking which is so lame\nSo Swag choked him and said, \"This Newark nigga\nYou'll lose here (hair) with or without the Rogaine.\"\nMy 14th battle against Illmac', a no name\nSo I cut his ass like Chinese chicken without the Lo Mein\n15th battle with Math Hoffa, an old lame\nHe like, \"Ars' what you holding up your fifth for?\"\nWhat I'm holding up my fifth for? Nigga I think I'm Broman\n16th battle out in London, me and Shotty Horroh going round for round\nWhere's your passport? Oh you ain't never get overseas money\nSo y'all could never go pound for pound\n17th battle out in Europe and you know I hate midgets\nSo I shot the Crome, I tossed it, you the Clip that came with it\nSo this make 18 to your 6?\nAnd y'all thought Clips was my best match up?\nThat's 54 rounds to 16, not 18 cause he had a one rounder versus X-Factor\nSo in a battle rap war zone\nHow can y'all compare Clips to the best rapper?\nWhen every battle this nigga had y'all gave him 7 months to rest after?\nNigga in a shootout would you rather 16 bullets or 54 and some?\nA whole Arsonal to spray a one Charlie Clip in your handgun\nNigga when my hammer drawn cut the cameras on\nLet's tape the man one\nCause Junior M.A.F.I.A. had them cameras on, pointed at Cam'Ron\nAnd we seen Cam' run\nNow I ain't ever seen Redman or Treach get treated like a sucka\nBut I did see Cam' and Jim Jones both get ran out the Rucker\nNow question, why oh why did Cam' not do Junior M.A.F.I.A\nLike he did Mitch in the closing scenes of Paid In Full?\nI mean why he wasn't acting like Rico then?\nStarted running round like a raging bull\nAnswer? Cause you Harlem niggas is pussy\nThat's one of the cards that I hate to pull\nBut since we battling a Harlem nigga that's pussy\nThat's one of the cards that you made me pull\nNow sweetheart I know I'm killing this nigga I disrespected you, I apologize\nSo I'ma go have ma a Coke and a smile and treat you to some dollar fries\nCause I'ma quadruple what I paid this nigga\nFor them 3 rounds of all kind of lies\nSoon as they edit, upload this video to Youtube and I click \"monetize\"\nNigga your life ain't worth the tag on my motherfucking shoe\nI put all this together, that you motherfucking knew\nSo accepting those 2 racks for me to kill you\nIs something you should never motherfucking do\nEspecially when you know I'm getting paid off of every motherfucking view\nMy shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic\nYou can't spell \"bars\" without putting that \"Ars\" in it\nTime nigga!\nSike I lied nigga!\nYou can no longer eat Big Mac's with fries nigga\nI'm at your front door with a big mac like \"Surprise nigga!\"\nFebruary 17th, 2013 Clips died nigga\nYour bitch be hoeing around, she hoeing 'round when she slob niggas\nThree words before that fat bitch suck dick\nI'm Going Down she Mary J.

two straps in both hands, four arms like when Goro flex\\nI\\'m tired of fucking random bitches, Charlie your hoe next\\nYour bitch don\\'t adore your sex, she played with balls since birth\\nBefore she learned to walk she did a Euro step\\nNow any battle rapper could\\'ve started a league\\nMine successful cause I got the larger movement\\nYou was mediocre against Tay Roc\\nBut since then I\\'ve seen large improvement\\nI think mine all the way through, see my visuals got a sharper blueprint\\nThis what happen when you put a high school dropout\\nAgainst the IQ of a Harvard student\\nIt\\'s all confusing, but it tickles my soul, it\\'s somewhat amusing\\nYou say you got me figured all out, so what I\\'m using\\nIf I say I\\'m tired of hearing bars about drugs or what you shooting\\nI rip your shoulders out the socket take your arms and hammer\\nNow what you using?\\nI heard when Hollow went down he\\nTried to start up a movement\\nBut was snugged with the wrong inmate so now he losing\\nIf I ran through all the New York and my title still undisputed\\nI got everything to gain so explain just what I\\'m losing\\nI will Clorox the stain in your brain soon as you lose it\\nThen take the 4 quarters and start the machine, that\\'s how you do it\\nYou ain\\'t sick nigga, you a hypochondriac\\nI knew how they was gon\\' react, but you and everybody in this building\\nStill don\\'t realize that I just took you to the laundromat\\nNow all these years DNA was missing a tooth\\nYou ain\\'t think that was a problem and wild?\\nYou supposed to be the big brother figure to that nigga\\nYou ain\\'t acknowledge his smile?\\nRumor has it his mom\\'s retarded\\nThat bitch must be or she just being childish and wild\\nFor actually give you the responsibility\\nTo try to be the daddy of her fatherless child\\nNow I ain\\'t the big nose midwest nigga\\nTo school niggas about their priorities\\nBut I am that disrespectful black Newark nigga\\nThat tell niggas just how they oughta be\\nIn your face all out in public cause your death I want \\'em all to see\\nThat Cannon bend you, while seven camera angles is recording me\\nWe gon\\' Youtube, Worldstar, Twitvid the whole crime\\nEyewitness news, Fox, UPN the whole nine\\nTwo big techs, I\"m throwing bullets like it\\'s two ticks left\\nI\\'m down 6 and I\\'m on the opposite goal line\\nI put my paw prints amoungst your offense\\nNigga the whole line/lion\\nYour boss sprints I turn to John Lynch and give him a clothesline\\nI\\'m all tense, this crowd is convinced I\\'m earn mine\\nThen I\\'m a slice you across your center, you a do not turn sign\\nNow you \\'bout six minutes closer to death,  you got about 3 minutes left\\nSo I advise you pray to your worshipper and take a deep breath\\nCause in this last round of bars, I\\'ma do a whole lot of exposing you\\nWait...I could hear his heartbeat, mannnn that\\'s what it\\'s supposed to do\\nMy shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic\\nYou can\\'t spell bars without putting that Ars\\' in it\\n\\n[Round 3: Charlie Clips]\\nShout out to my brother DNA, one of the best battle rappers alive\\nWhen niggas say that I celebrate, I pop a bottle give my nigga a five\\nBuy two cars, throw him the keys to one and just tell him to drive\\nWhen he was running around lost\\nI\\'m the one who showed him how to survive\\nThat\\'s real brother

two niggas out of Jersey, what about the others?\\nCause if you got beef with Joe Buddens and he\\'s fucking with your brother\\nThen it sounds like to me you got a family full of suckas\\nI could see mama Arsonal texting his phone\\n\"Hey baby come over for supper.\"\\nHe walk in with an attitude cause the first person he spot is his brother\\nOn his way to wash his hands in the bathroom, what did he discover?\\nA woman kissing on Joe Budden\\'s neck and it\\'s ya mother!\\nEverybody in your family likes Joe Budden\\'s Ars\\'/arse\\nI\\'m sorry y\\'all I gotta him him where it hurt\\nYou used to be the million view man now your view is in the dirt\\nYour career\\'s taking a fall and to make matters worse\\nBuddens took your brother out your life and then he just recruited Surf\\nAye Tsunami where you at?\\nI got some information\\nIt might get you a little heated\\nI don\\'t need to slow it down, put it in subtitles\\nI don\\'t even need to repeat it\\nAfter this call my phone on

It also shows an individual sojourning a thousand miles through this gloom to reach a ray of hope - a comforting smile.

Make sure to embody the frustration, the yearning for truth and the dissatisfaction towards perceived false promises.

Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nCame down upon her head\nClang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nMade sure that she was dead\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack in school again, Maxwell plays the fool again\nTeacher gets annoyed\nWishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene\nShe tells Max to stay when the class has gone away\nSo he waits behind\nWriting fifty times \"I must not be so, o, o, o\"\nBut when she turns her back on the boy\nHe creeps up from behind\n\n[Chorus]\nBang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nCame down upon her head (Do-do-do-do-do)\nClang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nMade sure that she was dead (Do-do-do-do-do)\n\n[Verse 3]\nP. C. 31 said, \"We caught a dirty one\"\nMaxwell stands alone\nPainting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh\nRose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery\nSay he must go free (Maxwell must go free)\nThe judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o\nBut as the words are leaving his lips\nA noise comes from behind\n\n[Chorus]\nBang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nCame down upon his head (Do-do-do-do-do)\nClang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer\nMade sure that he was dead\n\n[Outro]\nWhoa, whoa, whoa-oa\n(Do-do-do-do-do)\n(Silver hammer man)",

In a different scene, a man majoring in medicine is calling on a vintage-style phone. Suddenly, a silver hammer strikes unseen despairing each scene. The second act features a school, a bothered teacher asking a seemingly playful student to stay behind, with him writing a repeated line. Upon turning away, the student creeps up and the scenario repeats, the silver hammer strikes. Lastly, a courtroom scene: two hopeful women in a gallery, a stern judge, and a solitary figure as defendant. The silver hammer, once more, comes into play.",

She is dressed to kill with a lifestyle that signals luxury, symbolized by a Louis Vuitton bag. Money clearly plays a pivotal role in this scene – she's about business, not sentiment. Make sure to infuse a sense of danger, as stated in 'six feet under', maybe through coded objects like trap phones or suitcases. The goal is to encapsulate the essence of the song without using any lyrics or typographical elements.",

The woman, of Hispanic descent, reclines on a grand bed, her gaze distant, indicating her emotional unavailability. She represents the object of the man's affection who loves to lay, but doesn't return his feelings. In the background, a blurred silhouette of another man, of Caucasian descent and just one call away, symbolizes the competition for her affections.

      "rewrittenPrompt": "Create an image that embodies the song 'Nothing Without You'. The image needs to embody themes of deep longing, love, darkness and self-discovery. As imagery suggestions, show the interaction between two people, a female and male figure. The male South Asian figure expresses emotions of desperation while reaching out towards the Caucasian female figure, who is slipping through his grasp. The background is filled with foreboding darkness on one side, representing his fears, and intense light on the other side, showing his deep love for her. However, no typographical elements or recognisable symbols associated with the song are allowed. The image should depict a visual interpretation of the profound message within the song. The art style needs to be in a non-literal and distorted manner with focus on geometrical forms and shapes, reminiscent of early 20th century Cubist works, primarily using oil paint to reproduce the aesthetic.",

On one side, depict a Black man, his facial expression reflecting bittersweet feelings of love as he struggles to communicate his emotions. Readers should understand his overpowering desire to sacrifice everything for the woman he loves. On the other side, paint a Caucasian woman, torn between desire and fear, yearning for comfort yet battling loneliness. Infuse her eyes with a mixture of longing and resentment. Between them, illustrate an unbridgeable gap - a symbol of distance and time, that fails to alter the man's determination. As a symbolic representation of the lyrics, let there be recurring visuals of a heart intertwined with a ticking clock and a broken chain link conveying the themes of time, separation, enduring love and personal sacrifice.",

The image should feature decaying ties of friendship represented by two individuals gradually growing apart. One figure is on the rise, depicted by a symbolic representation like a staircase or a rising balloon. The other figure appears despondent, possibly with a fading light or other symbol showing their negative trajectory. The backdrop should feature a surveillance motif, perhaps through the presence of CCTV cameras, reinforcing the themes of mistrust and watchfulness. The overall tone should mirror the melancholic and somber notes found in the lyrics.",

A desolate landscape on a Sunday, empty and with no sign of life, transitioning to a brighter, bustling street scene on Friday. But there are also elements of difficulty and struggle - small items that loom ominously, pills and bottles subtly present in corners, a cloud of demons visible only to a solitary figure seen wandering through the scenes. Everything occasionally goes sideways, distorting the view. Towards the bottom, the scene deepens into a battlefield, with signs of fights, and in the center, two figures, one holding the other up rather than down.

In the foreground, there's an image of an aspiring musician, a brunette female of Hispanic descent, wearing a diamond-studded outfit with a tucked-in shirt, standing before a microphone. She's in the process of popping open a vintage soda bottle, symbolising 'pop the top, fill my cup up'. A mink coat, with a price tag reading '$80K', hangs ceremoniously in the background. Scattered around are euphemisms of wealth like symbolic pieces of a Tom Ford outfit, thousand-dollar shoes and a yacht. However, there's also a subtle reference to fleeting time with a visually striking and luxurious watch in a corner. The emotion it aims to evoke is of feeling it and being fully present in the moment, embodying the lyrics 'Can you feel it?'",

      "rewrittenPrompt": "Create a sequence of images imitating the style of a stop motion animation. The scenes should be able to communicate the tones and key messages of the song 'Another Way to Die'. Portray first an individual with a slick demeanour, handing over a document marked 'For the Queen'. The second scene shifts to a person with influential speech, luring others into their ideals. In another scene, illustrate a disastrous event transforming into a horrifying incident. The chorus calls for shifting focus to an open door with a woman passing by, a droplet making a ripple in a body of water, an intense gaze shared between two people, a phone sitting alone on a table, and the back of a man standing resolutely. These scenes should keep occurring in a cyclic manner, hinting that trust can be a deadly gamble. Introduce scenes featuring varying elements of treachery, sacrifice, greed, and power games. Throughout the cycle, it repeats – trust is just another way to die.",

The main characters, a diverse group standing together in unity, should be in the face of a sky falling apart, with a sense of resilience and unyielded spirit.

      "rewrittenPrompt": "An atmospheric high-speed photo, resonating emotions evoked by evocative lyrics: A lone figure runs through a dimly lit landscape, surrounded by the aftermath of what seems like a storm. The sky is filled with gathering stars as the light fades, hinting at the quiet dread of upcoming challenges. In their path, shards of glass gleam - a haunting reminder of a painful past. The runner's facial expression conveys fearlessness and resolve; they're prepared to face whatever comes, appearing on the brink of making a life-changing decision, their silhouette echoing a feeling of suffocation but also a pulsating desire to break free and feel the rush of love. The figure resonates the dilemma of risking it all and is juxtaposed against a blurred, unreadable scribble on a wall reflecting 'Writing's on the Wall'. The emphasis should be on the runner's journey, the stormy backdrop, and the contrasting calm of the stars, rather than any literal interpretation of the lyrics.",

      "rewrittenPrompt": "An abstract surrealist painting which visualizes the sentiment and essential message behind a melancholic song with themes of deception, unreciprocated love, and resilience. In the composition, imagine two figures separated by a winding river of blood symbolizing a broken bond. One figure is shrouded in shadows, depicting deception and betrayal. The other is standing strong, yet distanced, symbolizing resilience and the unwillingness to shed tears. The environment around them is eerie and twisted, with ghostly visages from the past emerging from the terrain, conveying the concept of past mistakes and lessons learned. There's an element of dichotomy represented as a potentially serene paradise and a daunting representation of death.",
